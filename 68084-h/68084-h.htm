</h2>

<p>Where a long spur of Chase Hill pitched down to the
broken land bordering on Birch Creek, Robin Tyler came
on what he had been seeking since sunrise. He pulled
up his horse, sat sidewise in his saddle to roll a cigarette,
to stare over the country, out over the wide roll of grassy
ridges and sagebrush flats that ended abruptly in the
confusion of the Bad Lands. As his eye marked single
dots and groups of dots that were cattle and horses
at rest and in motion, both near and far, a trampling of
hoofs in a hollow below made his head turn sharply. He
saw within a hundred yards the back and head and ears
of a single animal and jumped his horse into a gallop
with a touch of the spurs. He recognized that arched
neck and brilliant mane; it flashed in the sun like burnished
copper.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Red Mike,” he shouted, “you’ll have to burn
the earth now to keep me from ridin’ you on round-up.”</p>

<p>In two jumps the gray cow horse Robin bestrode
bounded over the low ridge. Below and beyond, a bunch
of range horses, twenty or more, as wild as the elk that
once grazed those slopes, stretched themselves like hounds
on the trail of a running wolf. They were headed for
a water hole and Robin was cutting them off. They lay
low to the ground, manes and tails streaming, their hoofs
beating the turf with a roll like snare drums. The horse
Robin had shouted at ran in the lead, a beautiful sorrel
beast with four white stockings and a star in his forehead.
Red Mike knew what a mounted man on his trail
meant. He was all for freedom. Behind him thundered
the wild mares with their colts.</p>

<p>For a week, at odd times, Robin had been looking for
that particular horse. Now he stood in his stirrups,
whooping in sheer exultation of the chase. It didn’t matter
how much he excited them. They were as wild as
hawks and would run themselves out anyway. He meant
to head them off from water, turn them back up the ridge
and when they tired he would bunch them in a corral he
knew, rope out Red Mike and lead him home.</p>

<p>He headed the wild bunch and turned them once. But
a badger hole hidden in the grass undid him. The gray
put a forefoot in the hole, went down as if shot, rolled
over twice and scrambled to his feet, trembling. Robin
fell clear, unhurt, except for the jar. He gathered up the
reins, swung to his saddle. The gray took a step. Robin
dismounted, stood looking with a frown. His mount had
twisted a leg, wrenched a shoulder. He walked on three
feet. Riding him was out of the question.</p>

<p>“Damn all badgers, anyway!” young Tyler muttered.</p>

<p>He looked after the band of broom tails streaking it
westward up the ridge. As he watched they came to a
stop, stood with up-pricked ears. Robin knew precisely
what they would do; stand awhile, circle wide and make
for that watering place by a cautious detour. He wanted
Red Mike. He needed him now more than ever. And he
was afoot in the blistering midsummer heat, fifteen miles
from the nearest ranch, in a region where no rider could
be expected to heave in sight.</p>

<p>Robin lifted his hat and ran his fingers through a
thatch of brown, curly hair. He was hot and thirsty.
Walking in high-heeled boots under a blazing sun was
not his idea of pleasure.</p>

<p>“I hate to leave you, old <i>caballo</i>,” he said whimsically,
“but I guess I’ll bid you a fond farewell.”</p>

<p>With which he stripped his riding gear off the gray
and turned him loose, undid the fifty-foot <i>reata</i> from the
bulging fork of his saddle and with the coils in his hand
bore straight down the hill leaving his saddle, bridle and
leather chaps in the grass, and the gray horse staring
after him.</p>

<p>Below him, in the gut of that coulee, a small spring of
clear water trickled out of a sandy hillside. Among the
seepage grew clumps of willows. In that screen a man
could lie perdu with his loop spread for a throw. If
Red Mike and his friendly broncs came down to drink he
still had a chance. If they smelled or sighted him and
dodged Cold Spring they would bear down into the bed
of Birch Creek. He would follow. It was no more than
a mile or two. Or he would lie at Cold Spring. He still
had hopes of snaring a mount. Small bands of wild
horses would drift in to drink. Among the wild ones
there was often an odd saddle horse, enjoying temporary
escape from ranch or round-up. At any rate he did
not propose to walk home. It wasn’t done! At the worst
he could snare an unbroken horse, hog-tie him, pack the
saddle down, and make the untamed one bear him somewhere.
Robin was a rider. He preferred them gentle,
but he could ride. So he trudged toward the spring,
keeping to the low ground, hoping that Red Mike would
not change his flighty horse mind about where he wanted
to drink.</p>

<p>Evidently Red Mike did. Robin lay behind the willows
until mid-afternoon, parched by the heat, chafing at
inaction. Of all the roving bands of horses none
trooped into Cold Spring. The wild cattle came down,
drank, lay in the grass until the slopes near by carried
a thousand head of resting longhorns. Some got wind
of him and departed in haste, snuffing and tossing their
heads. It did seem to Robin as if that fifteen-mile tramp
grew more threatening.</p>

<p>He decided to take a chance on Birch Creek. It was
no great way to the high banks that overlooked the deep
sage-covered bottoms through which a lukewarm stream
slunk like a great lazy snake, looping fold on fold. He
stole away from Cold Spring with care to dodge the
range cattle, to whom a man afoot was an unknown
sight, a strange upright creature to be attacked or fled
from as their bovine impulses chanced.</p>

<p>A little before Robin gained the first cut-bank whence
he could look into Birch Creek bottoms for a horse, he
heard a shot, then a second and a third. Robin had a
keen ear. He recognized those reports as from a rifle.
It held no particular significance, beyond the fact that
shooting argued riders somewhere near, and a rider could
soon solve the problem of a mount for Robin Tyler.
Since these shots came from the bottom directly below
him, Robin broke into a trot to reach the rim of the
bank and call to the man or men below, if they were within
hearing distance.</p>

<p>What he saw made him drop flat and do his looking
through a fringe of long grass.</p>

<p>Robin had grown up in a cow country. There was
little pertaining to the range, lawful or unlawful, which
had escaped his awareness. So he was at no loss to read
the signs below.</p>

<p>What he could not read were the brands involved
nor the faces of the two men. The three dead cows,
dark lumps in the gray sage, the three well-grown calves
hog-tied for the running-iron that made little wisps of
blue smoke puff from their ribs, were an open book to
him. It was as old as the cow business, that trick. It
originated in Texas in the chaos following the Civil War.
In the years since it had been intermittently practiced
with varying success from the Pecos River to the Canada
line&#8212;and beyond.</p>

<p>Robin knew the <i>modus operandi</i>. You had a few
cattle on the range. You owned a duly registered brand.
You rode abroad in lonely places, where range riders
seldom came except when the round-up swept through.
Having found a cow with a desirable calf you shot the
cow, roped the calf, ran your brand on him and hazed
the orphan off two or three miles from his dead mother.
Then you rode on and repeated the operation. Presently,
if you were wary, well-mounted, a good roper, and craftily
evaded being caught in the act, your natural increase
assumed great proportions. The cow, being dead, could
not embarrassingly claim a calf bearing a brand not
her own. A dead cow here and there on the range excited
no comment. Cows died from a variety of causes.
The cattleman knew that to his sorrow and the cowboy
accepted dead cattle as he accepted the sun and the
wind and rain, as natural properties of his environment.</p>

<p>Only&#8212;when too many cows were found to be dying of
sudden death there were sure to be riders abroad with
Winchester carbines under their stirrup-leathers. It was
apt to be unhealthy for those who sought to augment
their herd by other than natural increase.</p>

<p>Since every rustler knew that, he himself was not likely
to permit any one to view his activities with rope and
iron and depart untroubled. Hence Robin Tyler lay
very quiet in the grass. He was unarmed, to begin
with. He was not sure he wished to know the identity
of those two men, the brands on the dead cows nor the
fresh iron marks on the calves. That knowledge spelled
trouble. Somehow Robin had a distaste for trouble of
a personal nature. He had seen plenty. He wasn’t
combative. He seemed to have little of that primitive instinct
to fight, to kill, to harry other men, which crops
out now and then in even highly civilized persons.</p>

<p>Yet, as he stared at the two men in the silent flat, now
flinging themselves across their saddles to start the stolen
calves to new feeding grounds afar, he felt a touch of
resentment. He had an intuitive knowledge of what
brand could be read on those dead cows, because he was
sure he knew one of the men&#8212;the flash and glitter of
sun on silver ornaments as the rider’s horse wheeled and
danced under the restraining bit gave Robin this unwelcome
knowledge; unwelcome, because if confirmed, it was
knowledge upon which he would have to act, if he dared.
Would he dare? He didn’t know.</p>

<p>When they were gone out of sight down the Birch
Creek flats hazing the calves before them on the run,
Robin turned back to Cold Spring.</p>

</h2>

<p>The range cattle had finished their siesta and grazed
afar when Robin once more hid among the willows. He
was hungry but he had the solace of tobacco. He waited
with dogged patience. Perhaps the broom-tails Red
Mike ran with would yet come. If not there was always
the chance of others. If the cool of evening brought no
mount within reach of his loop he could still walk home.</p>

<p>So Robin lay thinking about those dead cows and the
men who shot them. He couldn’t get rid of the certainty
that came over him when silver conchos on bit and spur
and saddle flashed in the sun. He knew the man. He was
aware that he could be mistaken. Other riders caparisoned
with silver ornaments could be abroad on that
range. But the first conviction held.</p>

<p>Hornets and wild bees hummed among the willows.
Meadow larks swooped to the cold water, washed, preened
their feathers, swung on low bushes and caroled their
sweet, throaty songs within ten feet of him. Pungent
odors from sagebrush bruised by hoofs, the faint smell
of mud stirred by watering cattle, all the manifold airs
off a wide, hot land wafted across his nostrils as he lay
there. The sun dipped westward, fiery in the crystal
blue. The willows supplied a grateful shade. He grew
drowsy, dozed, and was wakened by nickering and the
thud of hoofs.</p>

<p>Luck had come his way. His sorrel horse stood with
forefeet in the mud, drinking from the cold trickle. The
band was ranged about the spring. Red Mike had set
himself as if posed to receive the waiting loop, within
range of a short and easy throw for a hand as true as
Robin Tyler’s, whose first toy had been a rawhide string.</p>

<p>He made one end of the rope fast to the root of a
willow, edged clear, shook his loop out. Then he rose
and threw in the same motion and the loop swished over
Red Mike’s ears and tightened about his glossy neck
before he could so much as toss his head.</p>

<p>One frightened surge against Robin’s weight on the
<i>reata</i> and the red horse stood still, wide-eyed with surprise,
but knowing himself a prisoner. Robin went up to
him gently, patted his neck, stroked him, talked to him
soothingly. The red horse nuzzled him. When Robin
took a turn over his nose with the rawhide the beast
followed him like a dog on a leash.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was mounted. Red Mike pranced
and side-stepped and pawed the earth with impatience, a
thing of steel and whalebone with the fire of life in it and
Robin’s spirits rose as if he had drunk wine.</p>

<p>The gray fed close by, nursing his lame leg. Robin
left him without regret, much gainer by the exchange.
Red Mike was his own horse. He had never felt another
man’s steel in his ribs. He was worth two of the gray.
So Robin turned lightly homeward.</p>

<p>But before the sorrel had spurned a mile of the dry
earth with his eager hoofs Robin changed his course, and
swung down into Birch Creek. He had to see the brand
on those dead cows. Why he <i>had</i> to he didn’t trouble
to define. In the back of his mind, unadmitted, there
was a motive&#8212;and the motive was simple loyalty to his
salt. Mostly the rustler preyed on the big outfits, and
the riders of the big outfits sometimes did not see more
than they chose to see on the range. But cattleman and
cow-puncher alike despised a thief who stole from a poor
man. And somehow Robin Tyler had to know if those
dead cows carried Dan Mayne’s brand.</p>

<p>They did. At least one did. Robin dropped his rope
over the stiffened legs, took a dally round the horn and
turned the animal brand side up. He saw the Bar M Bar.
He did not tarry to look at the other two lying fifty
yards apart, for as he leaned from his saddle to free
the noose something went <i>phut</i> in the sandy soil and
scattered dust in his face. Red Mike jumped, snorted.
A noise like the pop of a distant whiplash sounded away
off and high above.</p>

<p>Robin bent low over his saddle horn and gave Red
Mike his head. The sorrel crossed the Birch Creek flats
like a candidate for the Derby. As the dust rolled out in
a banner from under his flying feet Robin glanced back
over his shoulder. He saw two riders standing bold
against the sky line on the farther crest of the valley and
one of these riders gave off faint shiny reflections when
his horse moved in the sun, and there was also a glint
of metal in this rider’s hand.</p>

<p>They didn’t shoot again. The range was too great
to hit anything in motion except by a fluke. They had
scared him off and that, Robin surmised, was all they
wanted. They sat there while Robin put a mile between
himself and those dead cows as speedily as a fast and
powerful horse could cover the distance. Then he pulled
Red Mike to a walk, took to the high ground west of
Birch Creek and pointed his nose for another water hole.</p>

<p>He rode into the Mayne ranch in the cool dusk having
jingled around the south end of Chase Hill to pick up
three more saddle horses in their usual haunts. He
turned them into a small pasture, put Red Mike in the
stable, with an armful of hay to munch. Then he shed
his spurs and chaps and walked over to the house. A
light glowed in the kitchen windows.</p>

<p>Robin paused in the doorway to look at a girl lifting
warm food from the stove and placing it on the table.
Ivy Mayne was worth a look. For a long time now,
wherever he rode, unless the business in hand required his
undivided attention, Robin carried in his mind a picture
of this eldest daughter of Mayne’s. He could have told
you just how each separate coil of her glossy, dark hair
wound about her head, what dimples came and went at
the corners of her red mouth when she smiled. He knew
that her skin was like satin and her voice a sweet treble
like the thrushes that sang in the pine thickets of the
Bear Paws. She was eighteen and Robin was twenty-two
and they had lived under the same roof, galloped in the
same hot sun and under the same silver moon, faced the
blustering plains wind and lain in the grass together to
stare silent at the winking stars, for a little over two
years. There was not, Robin felt, her like for beauty
and sweetness in all the pine-clad jumble of the mountains
that loomed high in the velvet night to the northward
of her father’s ranch.</p>

<p>He always felt a queer flutter inside him when he was
away from her and came back. He felt it now as she
looked over her shoulder at his step.</p>

<p>“Did you ride clean out of the country?” she asked.
“Everybody’s gone to bed. I’ve been keepin’ your supper
warm, but you’d ’a’ eaten cold stuff in another half hour,
Mister Man. Hungry? Or did you strike some place
to eat?”</p>

<p>“Uh-uh. I’m starved.” Robin never wasted words.</p>

<p>“Where’d you go?”</p>

<p>He told her briefly of his mishap with the badger hole,
and his snaring of Red Mike at Cold Spring. Her eyes
danced.</p>

<p>“You sure do go into jack-pots and out of them
oftener than any rider in this country.”</p>

<p>Robin smiled. It was true. Old man Mayne had once
irritably told him that if he didn’t go around dreaming
he’d save himself a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>“Mark Steele and another fellow stopped in for
supper,” Ivy remarked presently.</p>

<p>Robin halted his coffee cup in mid-air.</p>

<p>“What for?” he inquired mildly. “Thought Shining
would be at the Block S getting organized for beef-gathering.”</p>

<p>“How would I know?” Ivy replied. “They said they
were just ridin’ around. They come in from the south.
I saw ’em a long way off. Mark asked where you were.”</p>

<p>“You tell him?”</p>

<p>Robin knew neither Ivy nor any one else could guess
where he rode to look for Red Mike that day. He hadn’t
known himself where he would go when he started.</p>

<p>“Dad said you were huntin’ horses.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell nobody, not a soul, not even the old
man, what I just told you about lamin’ the gray and
catching Red Mike by Cold Spring,” Robin warned.
“Keep that to yourself, Ivy. Will you? Forget it.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she demanded instantly.</p>

<p>“Nothing a-tall,” he parried. “Well, I have got a
reason.”</p>

<p>“All right, Robin, I won’t tell,” she agreed. Then,
laughingly: “You haven’t started draggin’ the long rope,
have you, that you don’t want nobody to know where
you rode to-day?”</p>

<p>“Dragging the long rope”, is a range euphemism for
stealing other men’s cattle, specifically unbranded calves.</p>

<p>“No,” Robin said shortly. “But somebody else is.
<i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>She nodded. Robin had seen something. He didn’t
want it known he had been where he <i>might</i> have seen anything.
Sometimes it was not good for a man’s health to
see too much, or to talk openly about what he saw. Ivy
herself was a child of the range. She understood,
nodded comprehension.</p>

<p>“I won’t talk.”</p>

<p>Robin leaned over the table to kiss her.</p>

<p>“If that silver-spangled <i>hombre</i> rides this way too
often I’ll get to worryin’,” he whispered. “Reckon you
could get to like him, Ivy, the way you like me?”</p>

<p>The eternal feminine flickered in Ivy’s dusky eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. “Maybe. I don’t
think I’d want to. I reckon I’d be a little afraid of him.
I guess he’d be a pretty bad actor if he got going.”</p>

<p>She put her elbows on the table and nursed her round
face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Everybody sort of seems to step soft around Mark,”
she said reflectively. “Dad’s a little bit afraid of him.
So’s other men. Are you?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t advertise myself,” Robin said.</p>

<p>He sat tracing a formless pattern on the oilcloth with
his finger for a minute. Then he rose. A faint, nameless
depression afflicted him whenever he linked Ivy Mayne
and Mark Steele in his mind.</p>

<p>“It’ll be daylight before you can sneeze twice,” he
said. “I guess I’ll turn in. I’ll have to step high and
wide to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He turned to put his arm across Ivy’s shoulders, to pat
her smooth hair. She smiled at him and blew him a kiss
from her finger tips as he went out the door. She herself
was sound asleep in her bed within twenty minutes&#8212;while
Robin lay on his blankets in a detached bunk
house listening to the audible slumber of a ranch hand in
the opposite corner. He lay tired but sleepless, turning
over and over in his mind the connection between those
dead cows, Mark Steele, Ivy’s father, Ivy herself, and
his own part in the play.</p>

<p>Should he tell Mayne about those slaughtered cattle
and voice his certainty about the man who shot them?
Both Mayne and Robin knew that for two seasons now
there had been a peculiar shortage in the Bar M Bar calf
crop. What Robin saw that afternoon in Birch Creek
bottom furnished the key to that shrinkage.</p>

<p>But he knew Mayne. Shining Mark Steele had Mayne
buffaloed. He would grumble and swear when Robin
told him. But would he act? And if he didn’t act the
thing would fester in his mind and sometime when he was
drunk he would talk. Once he opened his mouth Robin
Tyler was a marked man.</p>

<p>Robin stared up at the dusky ridge logs. He had no
desire to have his light put out by any bushwhacking cow
thief. Then he shrugged his shoulders and tried to sleep.
In the morning&#8212;Robin didn’t consciously say so, but he
had a feeling that such problems could better be solved
in broad day than by lying awake in the dark.</p>

<p>He rose with the sun. Sometime that day he was due to
leave to join the Block S crew as a representative of the
Bar M Bar on the fall round-up. He had a couple of
tender-footed horses to shoe, a few odds and ends of
gear to repair. He was a busy youth until noon. Not
until dinner was past and his string was bunched in the
corral with one horse saddled and his bed and war-bag
packed across another did he have any extended conversation
with Dan Mayne. They sat side by side on the top
rail now, looking down on the sleek backs of Robin’s cow
ponies. Mayne had given him instructions about shipping
beeves and fallen silent.</p>

<p>“I seen a dead cow yesterday,” Robin said at last. “A
Bar M Bar.”</p>

<p>“Wolves?” Mayne grunted.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Two-legged ones,” Robin exploded. The
words rushed out of him. “She was bit with a .30-30.”</p>

<p>Mayne looked at him, growled something through his
scraggly, dispirited mustache.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s how you’re short on calves,” Robin
continued. “Probably there’s quite a few Bar M Bar cows
dyin’ of heart failure that way&#8212;when they happen to
have big, unbranded calves that was missed on the spring
round-up.”</p>

<p>“The shrinkage ain’t natural, that’s a fact,” Mayne
grumbled. “We tallied a hundred less calves this year
than last. Should ’a’ been a good increase. It wasn’t
no hard winter.”</p>

<p>They sat wordless a minute.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s stealin’ you blind,” Robin asserted at
last.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Mayne admitted peevishly. He bent a
shrewd eye on his man. “You got an idea who, ain’t
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s all I have got, just an idea,” Robin declared.
“And if I go bellerin’ that idea out loud I might get
daylight let through me some day when I ain’t lookin’.
I’d ride a lot, if I was you, with a Winchester handy.”</p>

<p>“You seen more’n a dead cow yesterday, kid,” Mayne
challenged. “Spit it out. Where was you? What
happened?”</p>

<p>Robin told him. But he stopped short of uttering his
conviction that one of the riders was Mark Steele. The
information he did divulge he cautioned Mayne about
keeping to himself. That was as far as he dared go. If
Mayne took two drinks too many some day and shot off
his mouth about Mark Steele, Shining Mark would go
gunning for him, Robin Tyler, not for Dan Mayne.</p>

<p>The old man scowled, tugging at his mustache.</p>

<p>“I’ve suspicioned somebody was workin’ on me,” he
said irritably. “This cinches it. Keep your eye peeled
for fresh iron-work while you’re with the Block S. I’ll
get out and ride. By God!” he snarled in a sudden gust
of resentment, “I sure do hate a cow thief. And you
ain’t got <i>no</i> hunch who these two was?”</p>

<p>Robin hesitated. There was no guile in him. He was
loyal, with the peculiar, single-minded loyalty that
speckled Western America with cow-puncher’s graves,
from the Staked Plains of Texas to Milk River in the
north. No feudal baron ever took the field with more
devoted followers than the men who rode for the cattle
kings when the range was in its full pastoral flower.</p>

<p>“One of ’em,” he blurted out, “the one that smoked
me up, was right flashy with silver. I ain’t namin’ no
names.”</p>

<p>Mayne stared at him. His faded blue eyes blinked
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Great snakes!” he muttered. “I don’t blame you.
That sure makes it bad.”</p>

<p>He scowled reflectively. “The question is&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“The question is,” Robin finished the sentence in his
own way, “is he stealin’ for the Block S or for himself.”</p>

<p>“If he’s stealin’ for the outfit I got about as much
chance on this range as a snowball in hell,” Mayne answered
moodily. “If it’s his own iron, I got a show. I
wish you’d seen what brand went on them calves.”</p>

<p>“I was afoot, I told you. I don’t pack a gun. I ain’t
a damn fool,” Robin protested.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, kid.” The old man put his hand on
Robin’s shoulder. “You’re no gun man, but you’ll burn
your share of powder if you ever have to, I guess. Keep
your eyes open around the Block S. I’ll find them fresh-branded
calves, if it takes me all fall. And if you’re
right&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>He spat angrily into the dust and got down off the
fence.</p>

<p>When Robin drew clear of the ranch, jogging behind
his string of thirteen mounts, old man Mayne rode out
the other way, headed for Cold Spring with a blanket on
the back of his saddle and food in his saddle pockets.
Robin waved his hat to Ivy a last time before a dip in
the rolling land hid the ranch from sight.</p>

<p>A mile above the Bar M Bar he turned his horse back
into the creek bed, the same fork of Birch Creek that
flowed by Mayne’s house. Willows lined the course of
the stream. Under a clump of thick-trunked cottonwoods
stood a log cabin and a stable of peeled pine logs,
a round corral, all on the edge of a few acres of natural
meadow enclosed by a pole fence. Robin reined up at the
door. His ponies ambled on a few rods and stopped to
graze. He sat half-turned in his saddle, looking about
him with a pleased expression.</p>

<p>Ripe grass, yellow in the sun, ran in a rippling wave
to the door. Robin had crossed Illinois and Iowa, he had
gone more or less hurriedly through the great tier of
corn states once or twice in winter. He had never seen
wheatfields nor forest nor farmland nor pleasant gardens
in midsummer bloom. He knew best the range with its
endless miles of grass and sagebrush, peopled sparsely
by riders and lonely ranches, grazed by hoofed and
horned beasts. He knew the Bear Paws and the Little
Rockies and the Sweetgrass Hills, where pine trees grew
and wild roses bloomed in thickets under a June sun.
The Rocky Mountains were a faint blue wall on the western
limit of his journeyings. He had spent most of his
years on the great plains that spread east to the
Dakotas and south to Wyoming and Nebraska, where
northern bunch grass merged into the arid desert of the
southwest.</p>

<p>But Robin had imagination, without which indeed few
men functioned long on the range, and he could sometimes
see this bit of rich black soil about his cabin blooming with
color and tender green of grass and shrubs, a bit of the
wilderness taking on the atmosphere of a home where
beauty was something more than a casual word.</p>

<p>That was why he had claimed and homesteaded this&#8212;a
half-mile square of creek bottom&#8212;in a day when America
had millions of acres to bestow on her sons for the
asking. Title to it had been issued Robin only a month
since. He had proved up. It was his own. The first
definite stirrings of the pride of ownership moved in him
now. He didn’t see it so much as it was, but as it would
be; and Ivy Mayne loomed in the forefront of the picture.</p>

<p>“She’ll be a ranch some day,” he said to Red Mike.
“And we won’t have to steal nobody’s calves to get up a
herd, either.”</p>

<p>Then he shook up the red horse, fell in behind the
others and stirred them to a jog trot that carried him
rapidly across the rolling land under the shoulder of the
Bear Paw Mountains, toward the Block S camp.</p>

</h2>

<p>From the Bar M Bar to Shadow Butte, where the
Sutherland riders lay ready to start the fall work, was
a matter of three hours’ riding. The round-up was
camped under the Butte itself on a natural meadow in
Little Eagle, a lovely spot ringed about by groves of
poplars and clumps of willows, just where the foothills
lifted sharply to the timbered slopes of the Bear Paw
Mountains.</p>

<p>Robin’s string, heads up and ears erect at sight of the
saddle bunch scattered on the flat, went downhill on the
run. Robin himself drew up on the edge of the high bank
to have a look. He had seen round-ups sweeping the
plains, trail herds coming up from one horizon and vanishing
below another ever since he could remember.
Wild horses and wild cattle and wild riding had never
grown old, commonplace, to Robin. He always thrilled
a little to the sights and sounds of range work. Perhaps
because he was and had always been a part of it, dimly
conscious of its dramatic significance as the greatest
pastoral movement in the history of the world, of himself
as a minor figure playing a part in a spectacle bigger
than any of its actors.</p>

<p>He had risen in his stirrups many a time on last
guard to sniff the morning air, to stare at the sun’s
brilliant upper segment thrusting above the eastern sky
line, shooting yellow fingers across grassland that waved
and shimmered like silken crêpe. At such a moment a
queer glowing gladness in simply being alive, in being
there on the fringe of a sleepy herd with a good horse
under him, would give Robin an odd sensation. He got
the same feeling when they went thundering down a long
ridge, twenty riders abreast, elbows out, reins swinging
loose, to the music of jingling bits and spurs, the creak
of saddle leather. He had a touch of that strange uplift
now, for a moment. An artist with an analytical turn
might have defined it as a dumb response to beauty.
Robin didn’t attempt to define his feelings. He only
knew that when he looked down into Eagle Creek the
sight pleased him in a way he could not describe.</p>

<p>The white tents gleamed like snowflakes against the
poplar green. The yellow grass spread like a carpet
under the feet of two hundred grazing horses, sleek-bodied
brutes well broken to range use. Bells on the
leaders tinkled as they moved their heads in feeding. The
horse wrangler sat on the opposite bank, a lone horseman
silhouetted like a statue against the evening sky. Figures
moved about the chuck wagon. The smell of coffee and
frying beef floated up to Robin’s nostrils. In dry, thin
air that doubled the range of the human eye over a sea-level
atmosphere and lent an uncanny resonance to
sounds, the voices of the cowboys had a mellow ring.
Some one was singing a ribald trail song. Half a dozen
voices joined lustily in the chorus:</p>

<p style='margin:1em auto 1em 4em; text-indent:0'>“Comin’ up the Chisholm Trail<br />
I tell you what you’ll get,<br />
A little chunk of bread and a little chunk of meat<br />
Little black coffee with sugar on the sly,<br />
Dust in your throat boys, and gravel in your eye!”</p>

<p>Robin whooped once, long and loud, and jumped Red
Mike down the hill. He loosed his <i>reata</i> and slung a
noose. Fifty yards short of the wagons he swept like
a whirlwind upon the heels of his string, shot the rawhide
full length to encircle the head of the horse packing
his bed.</p>

<p>Five minutes later his riding gear was stacked under
his saddle blanket, and Robin was squatting on his heels
by the bed wagon swapping repartee with a dozen riders
he knew.</p>

<p>Shortly the cook sounded an alarm. He did not approach
these youths where they lounged and say in a
softly modulated tone, “Gentlemen, dinner is served.”
He seized a dishpan, hammered it vigorously with an iron
spoon, shouted raucously, “Grub pi-i-ile!” And the crew
swooped down on the chuck wagon like a flock of chickens
gathering about the mother hen when she clucked discovery
of fat worms.</p>

<p>The riders ate. A couple volunteered to help the cook
wash up. The rest withdrew. They sat about the bed
wagon, in the bed tent, sprawled on the earth, swapping
yarns. They had no cares. Without capital or
herds they worked on terms of perfect equality for those
who had both in abundance. Their life called for courage,
resource, initiative, endurance at divers times and
in strange places. Cold, rain, sleet, driving snow, burning
sun and buffeting winds, night watches on sleeping
herds, rivers in flood, wild horses, lip-cracking thirst allayed
by alkali water, days when they rode from sun to
sun and slept with their boots on wherever they could lie
down&#8212;it was all one. They took it as it came. Untrammeled
space, action swift and purposeful toward a
clearly seen end, work that was always tinged with the
excitement of the unexpected, barred monotony from the
range. Saving injury, the mishaps incident to what often
was necessarily wild riding, the cow-puncher worked or
sought diversion in uniformly high spirits. If he had no
clear sense of being a unit in Homeric episodes enacted
against a spacious and colorful background, he had a
rude dignity of his own as well as a sense of humor which
frequently took a Rabelaisian twist, so that his phraseology
often needed expurgating before it would pass
current in polite society. The tales circulating and the
cross-fire of talk among the Block S riders needs no repeating,
since it had no more to do with Robin Tyler
than to make him chuckle now and then as he lay on
his unrolled bed.</p>

<p>He had at once noted Mark Steele’s absence. Later
some one remarked that Shining was due to eat a cold
supper. Then in the dusk Mark Steele and Tommy
Thatcher, a lean Texan, noted for his uncanny skill with
a rope, rode in and unsaddled. The cook fed them.
Mark remained in the chuck-tent, where, with the privilege
of the wagon boss, he slept in comparative privacy.
Tommy joined his fellows.</p>

<p>“Well, we hit her for Big Sandy in the morning,” he
announced.</p>

<p>“Heigh-ho,” one stretched his arms wide. “Me for the
high pillow then. Once we hit Lonesome Prairie us and
bed’ll be strangers.”</p>

<p>Which was an oblique way of anticipating days in the
saddle and nights on guard while the Block S combed
the range for marketable beeves.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes silence fell on the camp. The men
were in their blankets. The nighthawk relieved the day
wrangler and moved his horse herd away from about the
tents. A moon swam up and Shadow Butte cast a long
black cone toward the northwest. Bells tinkled with distant
sweetness where the ponies grazed. Midnight
passed. When the few hours of darkness began to wane
a lantern broke out yellow in the cook tent. As the first
paleness showed in the east the cook lifted his call.</p>

<p>In less than an hour, with the sun heaving up above
the sky line the outfit was under way, all their equipment,
tents, cooking layout, beds, extra ropes and gear
piled high and lashed on two wagons drawn by four-horse
teams.</p>

<p>There were few trails and those dim ones over that
sparsely settled land. One rider acted as pilot across
country. In his wake the chuck wagon led the van. Behind
this rattled the bed wagon driven by the nighthawk.
Behind these came the saddle herd, urged on by the horse
wrangler with a trailing rope. Last of all the riders
mounted, shook the kinks out of their fractious horses
and broke into a gallop. Some passed the <i>remuda</i> and
the wagons. Some jogged leisurely. They rode as they
pleased, in pairs, in clusters, at a walk or a gallop.</p>

<p>Robin found himself riding elbow to elbow with Mark
Steele, “Shining” Steele. Appropriate name, apart
from the beaten silver ornaments with which he adorned
his gear, even to a row of conchos down the outer seam of
his leathern chaps, for the man himself was like a steel
blade, tall, lithe, thin-faced, a rider born and a cowman
from his heels up. Mark Steele had come into the Bear
Paws unheralded and unsung, and in two years had become
range boss of the Block S over the heads of older
hands.</p>

<p>He jogged beside Robin, hat pushed back, swaying to
the gait of his horse, humming a little tune, his eyes roving
over what spread before them as they topped each
little rise.</p>

<p>“Mayne give you a good mount, kid?” he asked presently.</p>

<p>“Thirteen head. And I brought along a ridge runner
of my own,” Robin answered.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. You won’t be afoot, then, half the time,
like you was with the Pool last spring.”</p>

<p>Mark said it with a smile but there was a sting in the
remark, an implied sneer. Robin had joined the general
round-up with the Bear Paw Pool that spring, having
only ten horses in his mount. Of these one had gone
crazy with loco weed, another grew lame. He rode
the remaining eight to a standstill trying to hold up his
end with men far better mounted. It was neither his
fault nor Dan Mayne’s&#8212;just ill luck. Saddle horses
had vanished, others had got crippled. There was no
time to break colts. But both Robin and the Bar M Bar
had lost a modicum of prestige. He didn’t thank Steele
for reminding him. He knew that with his present
string he could take the outside circle and come into
camp with the best of the Block S. So he kept silent.</p>

<p>“I was down to Mayne’s night before last,” Steele
observed. “You weren’t in sight.”</p>

<p>“Hunting horses,” Robin explained. He knew Mayne,
or Ivy, or both, had told Steele that. What business of
Mark’s was it, anyway?</p>

<p>“Where’d you ride?” Shining asked quite casually.</p>

<p>“So <i>that’s</i> it,” Robin thought&#8212;recalling the dead cows
and the rifle shot that put him on the run out of Birch
Creek bottom. Aloud he said: “Sand Coulee, Boggy
Spring, west side of Chase Hill.”</p>

<p>“Much stock in sight?”</p>

<p>“Quite a lot.”</p>

<p>They rode two hundred yards in silence.</p>

<p>“There’s thieves workin’ on this range,” Shining Mark
broke out suddenly.</p>

<p>“The hell you say!” Robin’s surprise was not simulated,
but it was surprise at information coming to him from
this source.</p>

<p>“I been ridin’ myself some lately,” Mark went on in
his crisp tone. “I’ve seen things.”</p>

<p>“What you been drinkin’?” Robin tried raillery.</p>

<p>Steele frowned.</p>

<p>“I seen some pretty fishy lookin’ work,” he growled.
“Pretty raw. There’ll be a necktie party when I get it
figured out.”</p>

<p>“Well, they can’t steal no cows of mine,” Robin said
lightly. “’Cause I don’t own ary a split hoof. You don’t
surprise me much. I guess there’s no range in Montana,
nor any place where cows run, that there isn’t somebody
packin’ a runnin’ iron and draggin’ the long rope now
and then.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you seen nothin’&#8212;no big calves with a fresh
brand and no mother handy?” Steele persisted.</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“If I’d come across stuff like that anywhere in Bar
M Bar territory I guess old Dan Mayne would be ridin’
the pinnacles with a Winchester and frothin’ at the
mouth,” he drawled. “What’s the brand?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t talkin’,” Steele said darkly. “An’ you keep
this to yourself what I say. <i>Sabe?</i> They’re workin’ on
the Block S mostly, I expect. But they might not
overlook the Bar M Bar. So keep your eyes open, kid,
an’ let me know if you spot anything that looks queer.”</p>

<p>Three or four riders behind broke their horses into a
lope, came abreast, laughing, elbows flopping like limp-winged
birds. Steele and Robin fell into their pace. In
a row, bobbing uniformly, hoofs beating out a steady
rhythm on the dry turf, they passed the saddle herd, the
wagons. The night hawk driving the bed wagon popped
his whiplash as they went by. The cook, acting Jehu,
braced himself by the four-horse reins, a cigarette in his
lips. Far ahead of the wagons they overtook and joined
the other riders.</p>

<p>At noon they camped two hours on a creek bottom, ate,
caught fresh horses and moved on. Mid-afternoon saw
the cavalcade top a rise below which, in the middle of a
great gray stretch of sagebrush, the town of Big Sandy
lifted a huddle of unpainted buildings. There the chuck
wagon would take on a month’s grub, the cowboys would
drink Bourbon whisky and play poker overnight, and
at dawn the Block S would depart into the wide waste
of Lonesome Prairie, to return again in due time with a
herd of prime beef cattle two thousand strong.</p>

<p>And all the way to town Robin wondered what Shining
Mark was getting at; what was his real object in
that conversation. Was he craftily seeking to discover
if Robin <i>had</i> been the rider on the sorrel horse who
turned over the dead cow to read her brand?</p>

<p>Or was he shooting straight when he promised a necktie
party for cow thieves unknown? When Robin gazed
at Steele’s easy erectness in the saddle, the flashy ornamentation
of his riding rig, he was troubled by a promise
of trouble. He was sure, yet not so sure.</p>

<p>More than ever he wished he had been able to see what
brand went on those calves that day.</p>

<p>Coupled with uncertainty went the firm conviction that
if Shining Mark once linked him with a knowledge of
those dead cows and stolen calves, he, Robin Tyler, would
need eyes in the back of his head whenever he rode alone.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chIV' title="IV—ONE STEP AT A TIME">
<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER IV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>ONE STEP AT A TIME</span>
</h2>

<p>The Block S outfit, far into that night, staged a good-natured
minor riot in a town whose population of something
less than a hundred souls was eighty per cent
dependent on Block S activities for its existence. There
were half a dozen small ranches within a ten mile radius,
men who owned from three to five hundred head of stock.
A few sheep-masters with flocks and herders and camp
tenders helped put money in circulation there and lent
a color&#8212;and odor&#8212;of their own to the region. Brooklyn-born
fiction to the contrary, the cattleman and
the sheep owner were not always at each others’
throats. The man on horseback tended to look down on
the shepherd who guarded his flocks afoot. In all history
the man on horseback has done that. But physical
clashes between the two groups only occurred when one
encroached too arrogantly on what the other deemed his
inalienable rights and privileges.</p>

<p>And all these folk lived under the tolerant shadow of
Adam Sutherland, whose Block S marked the ribs of
thirty thousand cattle. Sutherland owned the town site
of Big Sandy. He owned the general store and operated
the post office. If he didn’t own the hotel and the three
saloons and the blacksmith shop it was simply because he
didn’t care to bother about petty details of commerce.
So Big Sandy supported a number of people and activities
that were like mistletoe on the parent oak, some ornamental,
some possibly useful, but a secondary growth as
far as the Block S was concerned.</p>

<p>Sutherland had come into Montana with a beef herd
for a military post. He had remained to grow up with
the country. He had become big financially. He had
been a big man physically. Now that he was no longer
young his flesh was becoming a burden. He liked to jog
around the home ranch on Little Eagle in the summer,
to ride out and watch his men handle stock when the
round-up worked near home. He liked to be in Big
Sandy when his beef herds were marshaled into the stockyards
in a cloud of dust and see the fat steers go rolling
east in trainloads. He liked to see his riders have their
fling in town. His rule over all that lay under his ægis
was beneficent, almost paternal. Adam Sutherland had
never heard of such a thing as an efficiency system, but
he had its equivalent at his service, functioning smoothly,
ungrudgingly. A vision of the future was a phrase he
might not have fully comprehended, but he had that too,
or he would not have owned thousands of acres of meadow
land, the headwaters of mountain streams, a score of
unfenced pastures in a country where grass and water
were as yet free to all men, in a period when most cattlemen
still believed that the great plains must remain a
cow pasture for all time to come. The Sutherland holdings
dotted the foothills of the Bear Paws in a semicircle
fifty miles south and east.</p>

<p>He sat on the counter in the big store now, and greeted
his riders as they passed in and out making
sundry small purchases. Later in the evening he made
the round of the saloons and hotel bar, the Silver Dollar,
Monty’s Place, the Exchange, bought a round of drinks
for “the house” in each place. Then he went away to his
house set off on a knoll to one side of the town, a white,
sprawling cottage with a green patch of lawn about it,
surrounded by a picket fence to keep out the wandering
stock that sometimes strayed wide-eyed into the single
street of this frontier hamlet. The fence served also
the secondary purpose of keeping out over-hilarious cow-punchers
who might mistake the place for something else
and in high spirits&#8212;both literally and figuratively&#8212;undertake
to ride their horses up the front steps and
along the porch, crying a jovial challenge to those
within to come out and “whoop ’er up.”</p>

<p>Mark Steele’s outfit went north into the flat waste of
Lonesome Prairie next morning. The Block S cowboys
struck town again in something less than three weeks.
They had sent a trainload of cattle east from Galata on
the high line of the Great Northern. Now they drew up
to Big Sandy with a herd seventeen hundred strong,
sleek, fat, long-horned beasts moving like an army without
banners but armed with spears that glinted in the sun,
the slender wide-curving horns inherited from bulls of
Andulasian blood.</p>

<p>The outfit camped where the level of the Prairie
pitched down to the sagebrush flats. Robin went on
first guard with the lights of Big Sandy glimmering two
miles distant and five hundred feet below. East, west,
north, Lonesome Prairie spread its night-shrouded
breadth, an enormous, uninhabited triangle of grassland
a hundred miles on each side, with a railway crossing its
middle and scarcely a dwelling in all those miles except
the dull red section houses where the railroad laborers
lived.</p>

<p>Robin jogged his two hours and a half, meeting and
passing the other rider, around and around the outer edge
of a herd that slept as peacefully as a babe in the cradle,
a vast amorphous blot on the shrouded plain. They
crooned chanty songs as they rode, not because they
loved singing well enough to drone interminable ditties
for their hours on watch, but because a rider moving
silently in the dark might sneeze, flap a slicker, his horse
might stumble&#8212;and at a strange noise breaking the night
silence that herd would jump the bed-ground as one, in
a panic, making the earth shake with the thunder of their
flight. So they sang, crooned rather. And the relief
coming on at eleven o’clock came droning or whistling to
the herd.</p>

<p>“All right. You got ’em. See that you keep ’em.”
Robin and his mate jocularly greeted the relief, and departed.</p>

<p>Robin was paired for night work with Tex Matthews,
a middle-aged Texan, a quiet, soft-voiced man whose
gentle ways were a serviceable mask for a rider who had
seen a good deal of wild west in his time. They turned
toward camp. Matthews rode a little way, turned to look
into the flat below. In the dark and the silence a night
breeze sighed, as if the range breathed audibly. The
Texan stared at the town lights. Half the Block S crew
had ridden in when first guard was set. Sometime before
dawn they would come galloping back.</p>

<p>“They’ll be gettin’ action down there, I expect,” he
murmured.</p>

<p>“Let’s ride in,” Robin suggested. “I don’t want to
sleep, nohow.”</p>

<p>They swung their horses about. In fifteen minutes
they were dismounting before the Silver Dollar. That
particular house was the favorite resort of the Block S.
They patronized all saloons without favor, as a rule,
but the Silver Dollar was roomy, clean, it had a billiard
table and comfortable chairs. More important, it was
conducted by a genial soul who, having been a range-rider
himself, knew and welcomed cow-punchers regardless of
whether or not they had money to spend over his bar.</p>

<p>Now Robin and Matthews had neither expectation nor
purpose beyond a natural hankering for the glow of
bright lights, a drink or two&#8212;a little diversion, so to
speak. They would ordinarily have found some of the
outfit, perhaps have played stud poker an hour or two,
taken a stirrup cup and departed.</p>

<p>But once inside the door Robin Tyler had a strange
intuition of something in the air. Mark Steele leaned on
one end of the bar. Three or four Block S men stood
or lounged about. A couple of strangers were present.
And slumped in a chair against the farther wall sat Dan
Mayne. His chin was sunk on his breast. His dispirited
mustache drooped more dispiritedly than ever. But he
was neither asleep nor in a stupor. Mark Steele regarded
him with a smile that was a mixture of contempt and
calculation.</p>

<p>“Hello cowboys,” Steele greeted the two. “Couldn’t
resist temptation eh? C’mon. Have a drink. Ho, Dan!”</p>

<p>He called Mayne.</p>

<p>“Line up, old-timer. Have a shot.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t drinkin’,” Mayne snarled.</p>

<p>Robin, who had started toward him, and so stood
between the two, heard Mayne add a rider to the sentence
under his breath&#8212;“not with you, damn your soul!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t drink, do you?” Mark laughed unpleasantly.
“You just pour it down, that’s all. Come on,
kid,” he spoke to Robin, “line up here. The old man’s
on the prod, but the rest of us are sociable.”</p>

<p>Robin hesitated a moment. There <i>was</i> something in
the air. There was a subtle shade of the peremptory in
that “line up here.” The tone nettled him out of all
reason. And he didn’t like the conjunction of Dan
Mayne drunk and resentful in the same room with Shining
Mark Steele.</p>

<p>“Leave me out this time,” he said casually. “Looks
like I better put my boss to bed. I generally have to
when he goes on a bust.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself,” Steele replied tartly. “All the
same to me.”</p>

<p>That muttered sentence of Mayne’s was apparently
the last coherent speech he was capable of making.
Robin got him out of the chair, steadied his uncertain
progress across the way to the hotel and half-carried him
up to a bedroom.</p>

<p>He sat down beside him, and piled a wet towel on
Mayne’s head. In the course of half an hour the thickness
of tongue and brain partially cleared.</p>

<p>“You been squabblin’ with Mark to-night?” Robin
asked then. He wanted to know. If Mayne had jumped
Steele, he, Robin, would be in a difficult situation, working
under Steele. Somehow Mark’s attitude promised
trouble.</p>

<p>“Naw, not about <i>that</i>.” Mayne understood his meaning
at once. “I ain’t a damn fool altogether. But I
don’t like that <i>hombre</i>. And I <i>am</i> drunk. When I’m
drunk I ain’t got as much sense as I should have about
some things. Ivy’s in town with me. Mark he comes
ridin’ in about supper time and gets her corraled in the
parlor an’ sets there talkin’ the kid black in the face. So
I tell him to lay off, that I don’t want no flashy, silver-spangled
wagon bosses in my family. I wanted to say
cow thief instead uh wagon boss, but I didn’t. Least I
don’t think I did.”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a damn fool,” Robin said angrily. “Ivy’s a
blamed sight abler to stand off Mark Steele than you are.
I’m a darned sight more interested in who she talks to
than you are, an’ I sure wouldn’t jump any man for
settin’ talkin’ to her in a hotel parlor. Darn it, he
comes to the ranch, and you make him welcome.”</p>

<p>“No more,” Mayne asserted with drunken emphasis.
“’F he ever jingles his spurs on my porch again I’ll
ventilate him.”</p>

<p>After a minute he said thickly:</p>

<p>“I found them dead cows below Cold Spring. I rode
a week steady before I located the calves. I found ’em
fresh marked. I can’t prove nothin’. But I found ’em.”</p>

<p>“S-sh,” Robin warned. “Not so loud. What brand’s
on the calves?”</p>

<p>“T Bar S.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I’ve seen a few around.” Robin wrinkled his
brows. “Little bunch was thrown in on the Block S range
a year ago. Supposed to belong to some Helena man.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Mayne snorted. “I looked into that, too.
Helena hell! The T Bar S is registered in Jim Bond’s
name. I’ve known him a long time. He keeps a two-by-four
saloon in Helena. Never owned a cow in his life.
Them T Bar S’s was throwed in here last year, a hundred
and fifty head mixed stock. I bet you Mark Steele put
up the money. But I can’t prove it. I can’t prove
nothin’&#8212;yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you can’t prove nothing, you can’t, that’s
all,” Robin said. “You just got to lay low, and see
which way the cat hops.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to ask old Adam to-morrow if <i>he’s</i> got any
idea what’s goin’ on around here,” Mayne growled. “An’
I’m goin’ to ride an’ watch. Ride an’ watch,” he repeated
darkly. “Ride an’ watch!”</p>

<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER V</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>WATCHFUL WAITING</span>
</h2>

<p>Robin rode to camp alone. The Block S riders were
all gathered in the Silver Dollar when he came back to
where his night horse stood with the others in a row
by the hitching rack. Through the windows he could
see that a poker game had started. Tex Matthews was
playing. Robin didn’t want to drink. With his mind
fully occupied he somehow didn’t care to talk. He was
aware of a faint reluctance to facing Mark Steele while
Mark was in that hair-trigger mood&#8212;a trouble-breeding
temper, certainly quickened by a few drinks, that might
or might not have been generated by something Mayne
had said in his cups.</p>

<p>Steele was not rated a quarrelsome man. He could
be arbitrary, high-handed, and he had never been known
to give way an inch for any one. Even his ordinary
genial manner could easily take on an edge. He had no
known notches on his gun handle. But whatever obscure
inner force it is, that makes some men positive, and others
negative, in their human contracts, it resided in Mark
Steele, and exacted a certain deference among men who
were lightning-quick to resent any form of aggression.</p>

<p>So Robin, deep in his own reflections, swung into his
saddle and rode away to camp. If Ivy had not been
asleep in her room he would have tarried longer. But he
would see her to-morrow. He fell asleep, in a bed unrolled
on the grass, with his face turned to the stars. He
wakened once when the riders came pattering into camp
and got quietly into their beds. A cloudless sky brilliant
with specks of silver arched over him, a luminous inverted
bowl. Crickets chirped in the grass. Night horses
tied to the bed wagon, on picket, made their usual noises.
The bells on the <i>remuda</i> tinkled distantly. Small sounds
in a deep hush overlying a lonely land. Robin turned
over and slept again.</p>

<p>At daybreak the outfit mounted. There was a herd to
trim. While the bulk of that seventeen hundred bore the
Block S there were strays of half a dozen other brands
to be shipped, and these cattle were not jammed indiscriminately
into cars to be sorted in Chicago. The cattleman
unscrambled his own eggs.</p>

<p>From dawn to noon the flat a mile outside the stockyards
was a scurry of dust, flying riders, steers and cows
being shot out of the main herd into little bunches held
separate. Once sorted by brand and sex each group
moved into the shipping pens. By four o’clock the last
longhorn was on his way, two trainloads of him.</p>

<p>The riders were free until the following morning, when
the Block S would pull south. Thirty miles beyond
Birch Creek, beyond the Bar M Bar, Steele would throw
his riders on circle again to comb the range for beef.
The camp would move day by day toward the railroad
as the riders gathered a herd.</p>

<p>But now, as the last door clanged shut on the last
animal, the cowboys flung themselves on their horses and
charged down on the Silver Dollar. For ten hours they
had worked in heat and dust. They were hot and thirsty.
Cold beer was nectar to their parched mouths.</p>

<p>Robin stayed with the crowd for one round of elbow-crooking.
Then he crossed to the hotel. The Maynes
were still in town. He sought the store. As he clanked
up the steps he passed Dan Mayne and Adam Sutherland
perched on the planking, Mayne talking with
emphatic motions of his hands and head, Sutherland big,
fat, good-natured, placidly listening, chewing on a cigar.
Robin nodded and went on in, looking for Ivy. But in
that semi-public place he couldn’t talk to her nor she to
him even if she had not been deep in purchases of dry
goods aided and abetted by the blacksmith’s wife and the
hotel keeper’s daughter. Out of their natural habitat
both Robin and Ivy were shy, self-conscious. They exchanged
greetings. Robin bought a pound of Bull
Durham and took himself off.</p>

<p>Sutherland rose as he came out and ambled away
toward his house. Robin sat down beside Mayne. The
old man’s eyes were slightly reddened. Otherwise he
showed no sign of his overnight tussle with John Barleycorn.
His mind was still occupied with cows and cow
thieves.</p>

<p>“Sutherland don’t take no stock in any rustlin’,” he
complained. “He’s so gol darned sure nobody’s got the
nerve to rustle stock on the Block S range. ’Course I
couldn’t blat it all. I only told him what I seen myself,
an’ not all that either. He just laughed. Said if some
of my cows got shot it wasn’t because somebody was
stealin’ their calves, but more likely some poison mean
galoot had it in for me.”</p>

<p>“How’d he figure calves with no mothers and a T Bar
S on their ribs?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>“I didn’t go that far.” Mayne’s normal caution was to
the fore, evidently. “I don’t want to start nothin’ I
can’t finish. I got to know more before I go hollerin’
names and brands.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s good policy,” Robin agreed. “Still,
I don’t <i>sabe</i> the play. If it was Mark&#8212; Why’d he
steal calves for a man in Helena?”</p>

<p>“Bond’s probably a stall. Mark’s either got an interest
in that brand or owns it. Naturally he keeps that
dark,” Mayne replied sourly. “If them calves had had
a Block S on ’em I’d think my chances were slim to make
any money in the cow business around here. I thought at
first he was workin’ on me to make a good showin’ for the
Block S. I never seen a big cow outfit yet that wouldn’t
back a wagon boss in anything he did if he could show a
good increase from year to year. But when I see that
T Bar S I know he’s out for himself.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it ain’t Mark, after all,” Robin murmured.
“I’m not dead sure, you know. I went mostly on the
flash of silver.”</p>

<p>Robin didn’t say that he had been confirmed in his
first impression largely by Mark’s behavior since.</p>

<p>Mayne looked at him peevishly.</p>

<p>“Who’d you think it might be, then?” he inquired.
“Or has Mark got you buffaloed so’s you dassent think
out loud to me? ’S he been puttin’ the fear uh God into
you? You ’fraid of him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Robin answered truthfully. “He’s
done some pretty high-handed things in this country and
made ’em stick, hasn’t he? He’d be a bad man to tangle
with. He’s never made a gun play that I know of.
Still, everybody seems to take him for walkin’ dynamite.”</p>

<p>“He is, too,” Mayne agreed moodily. “He looks it,
acts it once in a while. I sized him up as dangerous the
first time I ever saw him. Some men are that way. Soon
as you look ’em in the eye, you know they’ll be poison
if you go up against ’em. Same time, nobody, if he was
deadly as a Gila monster, is goin’ to keep stealin’ my
stock and get away with it, make me think I like it. I
seen plenty wild west before Mark Steele was born. You
watch he don’t keep cuttin’ back unbranded stuff on you
when the outfit works south of the mountains, Robin.
The time to keep cases on him is all the time. If he drags
the long rope on my territory after round-up’s over, I
bet you I get him before the grass comes up in the
spring.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you were dead sure, but had no evidence a
stock inspector could make an arrest on, what’ you do?”
Robin asked curiously.</p>

<p>“More’n one way of killin’ a cat besides chokin’ it to
death with butter,” Mayne drawled cryptically.</p>

<p>As the Block S wagons, saddle bunch and riders
traveled south the next forenoon they passed one equipage
and were themselves passed by another on the trail
that ran to the Sutherland ranch on Little Eagle.</p>

<p>The first was Dan Mayne and Ivy rolling home with a
team and wagon. Robin jogged beside them for a mile or
so bantering Ivy. Then Mark Steele detached himself
from the other riders and joined him, and somehow the
light-hearted chaffering between Ivy and Robin ceased.
Mark did the talking. He was as genial as the sun.
Even old Mayne had to grin. But Robin didn’t. He
kept pace and was casual, but he wasn’t happy. And
when Mark said: “Well, kid, the outfit’s leavin’ us behind,”
Robin lifted his hat and rode on with Steele, in
spite of the fact that it was his privilege to join the
outfit when he chose. He wasn’t a Block S man. He
was a “rep.” But he went.</p>

<p>Steele tightened up as soon as they were clear of the
Maynes. It wasn’t anything he said because he didn’t
open his mouth. It was his manner, a subtle something
Robin could feel. Mark looked back at the team and
wagon once. Then he looked searchingly at Robin and
smiled&#8212;without a word. The mocking flicker in his eyes
made Robin uneasy. It was not the first time Steele had
manifested an interest in Ivy Mayne, although everybody
within fifty miles knew she was Robin’s girl.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” thought Robin, “he thinks he can get her
the way he’s gettin’ the old man’s calves.”</p>

<p>They joined the other riders. As they paced along
the trail some one noticed a little banner of dust far
behind.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s foggin’ it on our track,” Tommy
Thatcher remarked.</p>

<p>The “somebody” turned out to be Adam Sutherland, in
a fancy buggy, holding taut reins over a pair of standard-bred
bays kicking the dust out from under them as
if they were hitched to a racing sulky.</p>

<p>The buggy passed like a rider at the gallop. Sutherland
nodded. The cowboys lifted their hats when they
saw a girl in the seat beside Sutherland. The shiny
top was up and all they had was a glimpse. But that was
sufficient, for some of them.</p>

<p>“May’s back, eh?” one commented.</p>

<p>Robin had a flash of a pale face, fair hair, bright blue
eyes. He knew about Sutherland’s only daughter although
he had never seen her until now. She was getting
a formal education in the State capital, where Sutherland
lived in the winter, and sometimes she came to the home
ranch a few weeks in summer. She had been born on
Little Eagle when the Block S cattle numbered hundreds
instead of thousands. She was good-looking, the cowboys
said, and she had been very pleasant to crippled
riders laid up at the home ranch, but none of them knew
her well. She rode about in the hills a little with her
father, and a great deal more alone. The Sutherland
riders discussed her freely as the buggy grew small on
the trail ahead and disappeared at last over a rise.</p>

<p>“She used to love a good rider,” Amby Phillips said
reflectively. “So you bronco fighters can have hope.
One time she was half-stuck on a kid that broke horses on
Little Eagle&#8212;about four years ago, if I remember right.
I seen her sit on the fence and clap her hands when he
topped off a colt that jumped high, wide an’ handsome.
She used to run around with him a lot. An’ one day
a bronc went over backward on this kid an’ killed him.
She went all to pieces over it, they say. She ain’t been
here much since. You know her, Mark?”</p>

<p>Steele nodded. “Met her two or three times,” he
drawled. “I was over to the house last night. Nice
lookin’, all right. Kinda acts as if she was proud as hell
about something, though.”</p>

<p>Old Tex Matthews snickered audibly and Steele
flashed a cold glance at him.</p>

<p>“What you say, Tex?” he inquired with exaggerated
politeness.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say. But I was thinkin’ that if it don’t rain
soon and soften up this ground I’ll have to shoe a couple
of horses.”</p>

<p>Steele made no comment. There was a funny little
quirk about the Texan’s mouth when he made that answer,
and he looked straight at Shining Mark. For
some reason there was a brief silence, and after that there
was no more mention of May Sutherland. Presently they
stirred up their horses and tore down into a creek bottom
where the wagons were to stop for noon.</p>

<p>That night they camped under Shadow Butte again.
The following day took them far east of Birch Creek,
east of the Bar M Bar. The Little Rockies loomed blue
on the horizon beyond the broad reach of the Gros Ventre
Reservation. On their first ride they picked up a fair
sprinkling of beef cattle and Robin cut a score of Bar M
Bars into the day herd to throw back on his home range.
After that the routine of each day followed its usual
order of saddling at dawn, riding circle, bunching the
gathered cattle in a compact mass near the camp while
they cut out the prime beef and branded such calves
as had been missed on the spring round-up. Each day
they moved a few miles back toward Big Sandy, working
the range on either side of the wagons as far as they
could reach in one ride.</p>

<p>Robin noted a T Bar S here and there. Some of the
riders knew a Helena man owned that brand. None of
them cared about the question of ownership. They were
not owners. There were other brands on the range with
absentee owners. Somehow, because a generous honesty
was the accepted range standard the calves of such got
branded with the mark their mothers bore, and the steers
got shipped to market. If no special arrangement was
made for looking after such cattle the big outfits looked
after them anyhow. It kept the range in order. Unbranded
stock at large was a temptation to men anxious
to build up a big herd off a shoestring foundation. If a
rustler could get away with stuff from a little owner he
soon extended his operations to the big outfit. To the
big cattleman a cow thief was an affront to his jealous
sense of property rights&#8212;to the man with only a few
head the same thief was a poisonous sneak who took
the bread out of his mouth while he slept.</p>

<p>Robin went about with his keen eyes wide open. He
saw nothing suspicious nor did he expect to see such
except by chance. For that chance he was always alert.
And within a week, when the Block S worked certain
ridges east of Birch Creek chance came his way.</p>

<p>He had noted one thing. Invariably when Mark
Steele led his riders on circle and scattered them by
twos and threes to make a sweeping drive back toward
the wagon, he kept Tommy Thatcher with him. That
might have been accident or inclination. Every man has
his preferences. If Mark preferred Thatcher’s company
there was no one to gainsay his choice. For whatever
reason, Thatcher and Steele were Siamese twins
when it came to riding the outside. The odd fancy that
the T Bar S spelled Thatcher &amp; Steele took hold of
Robin’s mind. He knew better. The T Bar S was an old
brand. It had changed hands many a time. Still the
idea lingered with Robin.</p>

<p>On a certain afternoon the riders finished working a
gathered herd. Every outfit, on its home range, took
the first cut. When they had finished with the round-up
the “reps” could ride in to see if anything of theirs had
been overlooked.</p>

<p>Steele waved to Robin.</p>

<p>“Look ’em over,” he invited. “I cut a couple of your
cows with unbranded calves.”</p>

<p>Robin had seen that. It was his business to see such
things. But he had spotted another cow with a calf well-grown
in that milling mass and he knew other men must
have seen them also. None of them would mention
the fact, unless he asked. A “rep” was supposed to know
his business. He turned and twisted in that jumble of
moving beasts until he found what he looked for, and
cut them into the bunch being held. He knew precisely
how many unbranded calves with Mayne mothers were in
that cut. While four riders threw the beef into the day
herd the rest built a fire, put in the irons. There were
perhaps forty calves to be branded. Robin was delegated
to run an iron. As each calf came dragging to the
fire the roper called the brand of his mother cow. With
a dozen men on the job it was soon done.</p>

<p>“’At’s all.” Thatcher stopped and coiled his rope.</p>

<p>“All right. Turn ’em loose,” Steele ordered curtly.</p>

<p>Robin flung himself on his horse and tore after the
cattle that were already departing at a trot, running
out a noose as he went. He knew what he was after. He
had an extremely tenacious memory for animals.</p>

<p>He spotted his objective, swung his loop, took his
turns and came back dragging a red calf full six months
old. Fifty yards behind a Bar M Bar cow came bawling
a loud protest at the maltreatment of her offspring.</p>

<p>The irons had been drawn, the fire partly kicked apart.
But when they saw Robin with his calf an iron went back
into the coals.</p>

<p>“Good eye, kid,” Steele commented. “They overlooked
one on you. Some of these stock hands losin’ their eyesight,
I guess.”</p>

<p>No more was said. The calf ran free, squirming at the
smarting mark on his side. But Robin wondered how
often that sort of thing happened to Mayne cows in the
course of the season’s round-up. He couldn’t be everywhere.
It was not humanly possible for him to see everything.
And he nursed the conviction that any Bar M
Bar calf overlooked like that would carry a T Bar S
before spring.</p>

<p>It was a tough proposition, he said to himself, a hard
game. The cards were stacked; the play crooked.</p>

<p>If he could just once get Mark Steele dead to rights!
Robin had never fired a shot in anger in his life. But
he felt now, at rare moments, that under certain circumstances
homicide was not only justifiable but
righteous.</p>

<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER VI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>EVIDENCE IN THE CASE</span>
</h2>

<p>At the outer end of a long ride, a circle which was
carrying them deep into the Bad Lands lining the north
side of the Missouri River, Robin found himself riding
beside Mark Steele after all the other riders save Tommy
Thatcher, Tex Matthews and himself had been turned
off. They had fallen into pairs. Thatcher and Matthews
jogged fifty yards in the rear.</p>

<p>“You mentioned rustlers one time to me,” Robin said
guilefully. “I haven’t seen no sign of crooked work.
Did you dream somebody was draggin’ the long rope
on the Block S range?”</p>

<p>“If you were awake,” Mark retorted, “you might notice
that slick-ears is damned scarce in this rough country
where there’s generally plenty on account of bunches
being missed here and there.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” Robin answered. “But I haven’t noticed
anything that looked like a maverick totin’ a strange
brand, either.”</p>

<p>“Look here.” Shining Mark lowered his voice. “What
I said to you and what I say now is not for publication.
I told you because you work for old Mayne and I reckon
he can’t afford to have his stock stolen. You can tell
old Dan what I said if you like&#8212;but you can tell him
likewise that if I hear any loose talk about cow thieves
there’ll be dust flyin’ around him. I know what’s goin’
on. I don’t want no rustler tipped off that I’m on his
trail. You tell old Mayne to either keep his face closed
or stop drinkin’ whisky.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell him yourself,” Robin suggested
mildly.</p>

<p>“I’m tellin’ <i>you</i> to tell him,” Steele drawled coolly.
“You’ll see him first, I guess. And that goes for anybody.
<i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>He shot the last word at Robin as if it were a challenge.</p>

<p>“Don’t know as I do, but I hear what you say,” Robin
answered slowly.</p>

<p>Steele rode along looking sidewise at him now and
then. Robin was sensitive to impressions. He felt that
this slender and capable range foreman regarded him
with suspicion and annoyance, and a touch of contempt.
Whether there was more in the back of Mark Steele’s
mind Robin couldn’t say. Mark’s words did sound like a
threat. Robin suspected Steele meant his message to
Dan Mayne to be taken as a threat. It was as if he said,
“You fellows keep off my trail or you’ll get hurt.”</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be the first time in the history of the cow
business, Robin knew, that a range boss had used his
delegated power and freedom of movement to feather his
own nest at the expense of other people. Nor would
Shining Mark be the first man to grow restive and see
red when he found himself in danger.</p>

<p>Robin knew he had to be wary&#8212;or blind. Steele was
obliquely warning him that he and Dan Mayne had better
be blind. But he did not let Steele know that he so
understood. He simply said:</p>

<p>“So long as this sight unseen cow thief don’t show
his mark on anything belonging to the man I work for,
I leave him&#8212;or them&#8212;to you. The Block S can take
care of its own.”</p>

<p>“You’re damned right it can,” Steele said tartly, “long
as I run it. I don’t like cow thieves, myself.”</p>

<p>Again that curious repetition, emphasised Robin had
no acquaintance with classic literature, or he might have
retorted: “Methinks thou dost protest too much.”</p>

<p>As it was he said nothing.</p>

<p>A mile farther Steele pulled up. When the other two
came abreast he pointed into a ravine pitching down to
a steep-walled canyon.</p>

<p>“You and Tex,” he instructed Robin, “drop in here
and get across on top of that other bench. Shove everything
from there on back to camp. We’ll take in the
flat at the river and come up the bottom of the canyon.”</p>

<p>They parted. When Matthews and Robin reached the
high bench across the canyon the other two were near
the drop-off into the river, riding fast. Robin reflected
that if there were any Bar M Bar cows with unbranded
calves in that river flat they would probably stay there.
But orders were orders. He couldn’t go one place when
he had been told to go elsewhere. A range boss’s word
was law on round-up. If a “rep” didn’t like it he could
cut his string and go home.</p>

<p>Bunches of cattle dotted the long, narrow plateau they
had gained. The wild brutes fled before them until the
dry soil smoked under their feet. All they had to do
was lope and yell now and then. The cattle could only
follow that bench north to the round-up ground. Where
Tex and Robin crossed the canyon was the only possible
crossing in ten miles.</p>

<p>But though Steele had ordered them to work back from
there, between them and the river the bench held other
cattle.</p>

<p>Tex rested both hands on his saddle horn and looked
south. He frowned. A cow-puncher on circle is supposed
to get all the cattle in sight except on ground he
knows will be swept by other riders. They were both
aware of that. Robin didn’t need to ask what Tex was
thinking.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t none too clear, was he, kid?” Tex remarked.
“He said to work back. But if one of ’em don’t
come up behind us there’ll be a parcel of stuff missed.”</p>

<p>“Let’s linger awhile,” Robin suggested. “See if one
of ’em shows up. They’ll be in the river bottom by now.”</p>

<p>They got down off their horses, sought the shade of a
clump of jack pine. Half an hour passed. Those distant
cattle fed undisturbed.</p>

<p>“If they came up the canyon they ought to be abreast
of here now.” Robin broke a long silence.</p>

<p>“Yep. Let’s ride,” Tex muttered.</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Look into the canyon first.”</p>

<p>A view of that deep gorge, straight-walled, floored
with sage, gave sight of cattle feeding quietly between
them and the river.</p>

<p>“No riders in sight,” Tex commented. “Maybe they
went swimmin’. Reckon we better get those cattle below
us on the bench, kid.”</p>

<p>“Mark’ll bawl us out if one of them does come up
behind us,” Robin observed. “But I ain’t workin’ for
the Block S. I don’t want to miss cattle.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t supposed to miss cattle,” Tex replied. “As
a matter of fact I remember now that a man can’t ride
up on this bench from the river bottom. Steele and
Thatcher got to come up the canyon. I was mixed up
on that proposition a couple of years ago on a pack
trip down here. Mark knows that too. I guess he forgot.”</p>

<p>They turned and rode south. Because to ride down
the bench openly would start every hoof running toward
the blind cliff overlooking the Big Muddy they sought
the farther side and worked along under the brow, out
of sight, until they judged they were south of the last
bunch. It was rough going on steep sidehills with loose
earth crumbling underfoot, gullies to scramble over,
thickets of jack pine to scrub their faces with low
branches.</p>

<p>They came out on the bench again less than half a
mile from the plateau end. Between them and where they
had crossed the canyon at least a hundred and fifty cattle
showed.</p>

<p>“Shucks, there sure would have been a bunch of stuff
missed,” Tex grunted.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look into the bottom,” Robin said. “Let’s
look at the old Missouri once more for a change.”</p>

<p>“Go look your head off,” Matthews said good-naturedly.
“I’ve seen her plenty. I near drowned in
her two or three times. She’s no beautiful sight I long
to see.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll catch you.”</p>

<p>Robin headed for the end of the bench on a high run.
He wanted to look. He didn’t know what he expected
to see. He didn’t know if there was anything to be seen.</p>

<p>What he did lay eyes on was sufficient to make him
whirl his horse back out of sight the moment his eyes
peered over the high bank. Then he dismounted, crawled
to the rim and lay flat on his stomach, just as he had
lain and looked that afternoon on Birch Creek, a deeply
interested spectator.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of activity in that lonely
bottom. Fairly in the middle of a flat three hundred
yards wide and half a mile long Steele and Thatcher had
bunched about a hundred head of cattle of all ages. With
only two riders to hold them this herd surged first one
way then another and the two horsemen kept their mounts
on the jump. Yet now and then one or the other managed
by a combination of speed and skill to cut off a
cow and a calf and turn them toward the blind end of
the flat.</p>

<p>Robin watched for half an hour. By that time the
job was done. At least thirty cows and calves had been
separated from the herd. Then Steele and Thatcher
headed the remnant of mixed stuff into the mouth of
the wide canyon.</p>

<p>Robin mounted and sped south to overtake Matthews,
who loped along with little bunches of wild cattle streaking
out ahead of him. Robin had seen enough. Back in
that bottom was a lot of fine material for Steele and
Thatcher to work on at their leisure when round-up was
over. No riders would sweep that territory for seven
months. Those cows and calves would winter in the
bottom. They would not see a rider until that precious
pair came down to run the T Bar S on the calves. God
only knew what would befall the cows. But whatever
happened to them, long before spring, cows and calves
would be separated, and the fresh brand scars healed.
No one would ever question that indelible mark of ownership.</p>

<p>Robin was satisfied up to a certain point. He had
an idea how they worked. He knew who they were. No
doubt of that remained. He was pretty sure that
although there might be Bar M Bars in that throwback,
there must be other brands, that in every place where
this pair of thieves took the outside circle there would
be cows and calves thrown back to be worked on later.
Robin felt sure they played no favorites. He wondered
what Adam Sutherland would say if he knew. He did
not have to wonder how Dan Mayne would take it. Robin
wished he had prevailed on Tex to ride with him to that
jump-off. He had only his own word, as yet, in spite
of what he had seen. So he couldn’t talk, even to Tex
Matthews, whom he liked and felt he could trust. He
could only relate this tale of wonders beheld to Dan
Mayne, whom he couldn’t trust to keep still.</p>

<p>Still, Robin was sanguine that in time, in not too great
a span of time, Steele and Thatcher, with a little secret
assistance from himself, would tangle themselves in their
own ropes. The stock inspectors would get them, if a
necktie party from the Bear Paws didn’t get them first.</p>

<p>He rode fast. He wanted to be well ahead of those
two driving the canyon. He took the opposite side of
the bench from Tex and stirred the running cattle to
even greater speed. Matthews spurred up to join him.</p>

<p>“Hey, what’s the rush?” he inquired. “What for the
Blocker graze? Sutherland wouldn’t thank you for
meltin’ the tallow off’n his steers’ ribs thataway.”</p>

<p>Robin let that go by. It struck him that he had better
stop Tex from casual talking.</p>

<p>“Say, Tex,” he put it bluntly. “Don’t you let out
I rode down where I could look into the river bottom,
will you?”</p>

<p>Matthews stared at him for a second. Robin matched
his gaze without change of expression. The Texan suddenly
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’m deef, dumb an’ blind,” said he. “What’d we do?
Cross the canyon, see a few head behind us, a little back,
an’ get ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if anybody asks,” Robin agreed.</p>

<p>“Guess maybe we <i>had</i> better run a little fat off these
steers,” Tex drawled, “else we sure will have Mark inquirin’
where in hell we were at. An’ you don’t want
him gettin’ curious? Eh?”</p>

<p>“You’re gettin’ curious?”</p>

<p>The Texan shook his head.</p>

<p>“I been on many a cow range since I quit the Rio
Grande,” said he. “An’ on some of ’em I learned not to
be curious. It’s a wise cow-hand that knows enough to
keep his mouth shut. The flies don’t get in.”</p>

<p>“Blow flies,” Robin muttered.</p>

<p>Tex laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re a bright kid,” he said teasingly. “Let’s push
these cows on an’ talk about the weather.”</p>

<p>They hazed the cattle up the bench, between those
gaudy canyons, torn out of the plains level as if by some
Gargantuan plow. Robin loped over to the rim of the
canyon once for a look down. Cattle were running. He
could see the glint and flash of shining horns. Far back
a haze of dust showed where Steele and Thatcher were
punching up the drag. Robin felt easier. He and Tex
were well ahead of that thieving pair. Mark would not
be suspicious of spying from above.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour after they threw their cattle on the
round-up ground Steele and Thatcher came in with a
couple of hundred head. They were the last drive. Their
horses were rough with sweat, tired. When they rode
into camp to catch fresh mounts to work the herd Mark
commented on their ride. To Robin it seemed like overdoing
the thing.</p>

<p>“Ten miles for nothing,” Mark observed to him casually.
“There was a lot of stuff in the canyon, but
hardly a dozen head in the river bottom.”</p>

</h2>

<p>When the Block S hauled in to a camp ground midway
between the Bar M Bar and the Sutherland ranch
its beef herd numbered close on two thousand head. They
were pulling for the railroad. With that herd off
their hands one more sweeping of the range between
Mayne’s and Big Sandy would end the fall round-up.</p>

<p>Robin came off day herd at four thirty of a September
afternoon. He was through for the day. He had no
guard to stand that night. But when the wrangler
bunched the <i>remuda</i> in the rope corral strung from the
wheels of the bed wagon, he caught a horse just the
same.</p>

<p>Steele looked at him inquiringly. Robin half expected
him to ask the why of a horse. A cow-puncher free of
appointed duty came and went as he pleased, giving no
account of his movements unless he chose. A “rep” had
even wider latitude.</p>

<p>It would not in the least have surprised Robin if
Steele had overstepped a range boss’s privilege in regard
to his movements. Each day in subtle, silent ways,
Shining Mark evinced more of a tendency to “ride” him,
and Robin couldn’t get away from the idea that Mark
was slowly but deliberately working up to a point where
the Bear Paws would not be big enough to hold them
both. There was a definite limit to what a man could
stand. To keep his peace, avoid friction, until Mark
crowded him too hard was the only course Robin could
see to pursue.</p>

<p>With a little more than two hours’ daylight ahead
of him he pointed for the Bar M Bar. Whether Steele
showed his teeth or not Robin would be true to his salt.
If Shining Mark had been thundering on his trail to
start a private war Robin would still have ridden home
that night to tell Mayne he had better ride those river
bottoms and get his calves before Steele and Thatcher
got around to them.</p>

<p>Mayne would fume, but he would save his stock&#8212;unless
there were other rustlers in league with Steele.
Robin didn’t think that likely. Steele was a lone wolf,
not a gangster. That was his clearest impression of
the man; that Mark stood on his own feet, played his
own hand strictly for his own benefit. If Thatcher was
in with him it was simply because Steele could use
Thatcher to advantage. Somehow, Robin gave little
thought to this Texan confederate of Steele’s. In that
he made a slight mistake for which he paid later.</p>

<p>He had ten miles to make. As he rode the faint uneasiness
that afflicted him most of the time around the
Block S, a feeling born of the conviction that Mark Steele
would make some break when he least expected it, fell
away from Robin. The cool evening air was pleasant
on his face. He stood in his stirrups and chanted the interminable
rhymed history of Sam Bass, who was born in
Indiana but who roamed unto Texas a cowboy for to be.
Robin was happy. His lusty young voice kept time to
the beat of his horse’s hoofs. He was going to see Ivy
for an hour or so. Sufficient unto the day&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>In a coulee he jumped a bunch of wild horses. As they
broke away and tore up the opposite slope Robin spotted
among them the gray cow horse he had left a cripple by
Cold Spring. In his own round-up mount one horse had
gone sore-footed, another had a cinch sore. Robin could
not only use another horse but he foresaw tall riding for
Dan Mayne, and the gray would be useful. So he fell in
behind the broom tails. He had all night to get back. A
few miles more or less didn’t matter.</p>

<p>He was well mounted but he couldn’t quite head the
wild bunch. They raced away northwest from the Bar
M Bar and toward the Sutherland ranch as if the devil
was on their heels. On the plains as well as the sea a
stern chase is sometimes a long one. But after half an
hour of headlong galloping he drew up on them. Whereupon
the long-tailed mares gave up their frantic effort
to get out of the country and settled to a docile
trot, permitting themselves to be driven at will. Robin
promptly hazed them into a wild-horse corral standing
lonely in the creek bottom and there roped the gray.</p>

<p>By some kink in his equine make-up the gray had never
become properly halter broken. He would not lead as
a sensible cow horse should. His progress at a rope’s
end was a series of stubborn leg-stiffenings. Robin knew
his game. You didn’t lead the gray; you towed him.
So Robin saddled him for riding. His other horse would
lead at any pace by a grocery cord.</p>

<p>Now the gray had fattened and grown high-spirited
with weeks of freedom. Something of the wild always
lurked in the cow horse until his heart was broken or his
legs grew stiff. Robin knew that for about one minute
and a half he would have to ride. The gray was a powerful
beast, active, deep-chested, hot-blooded. He would
sink his head the moment Robin’s leg crossed his back.
Once convinced that he couldn’t buck off his rider he
would be gentle as a lamb.</p>

<p>So Robin tied his sweaty horse to a post and turned
loose the broom tails. They left for parts unknown in
a cloud of dust. The gray, walking stiff-legged, a decided
hump in his back, snorting protest against the tight
cinch, he led outside.</p>

<p>When Robin topped off a snaky one he liked room; he
didn’t like his legs being banged against corral posts.
About this corral there lay a flat made to order for
bronco busting. It ran level as a lawn for a couple
of hundred yards, brown springy turf on which a plunging
horse could keep his feet. Robin Tyler could ride any
horse that ever lived so long as the brute would stay
right side up.</p>

<p>He had no special technique, except to get in the
saddle and stay there. He doubled the gray’s head back
toward his shoulder, put his foot gently in the stirrup,
took firm hold of the horn.</p>

<p>The moment his weight came on horn and stirrup the
gray went in the air&#8212;and Robin went with him. The
leather leg of his <i>chaparejos</i> smacked against the fender
on the off side. His boot went home in the stirrup. He
whooped once, long and loud, in sheer exultation at the
plunge and shock and twist. The gray wasn’t mean.
But he could and did pitch high and hard and fast. The
whirl of his contortions took him across the flat with little
pieces of sod torn loose and flung aside by his hoofs.</p>

<p>Robin rode him straight up as he rode them all. He
never admitted it, but he never failed to get a decided
thrill out of such a set-to. Not once did the gray show
daylight between Robin and his saddle. He held his
reins in one hand. With the other he snatched the soft
gray Stetson off his head so that the sun made glints
on his brown wavy hair while he fanned the gray and
taunted him and laughed out loud without quite knowing
why he laughed when the horse made his last high, stiff-legged
plunge and brought up, breathing hard, rattling
the bit in his mouth within a few feet of a clump of
quaking aspen that stood on the bank of the creek.</p>

<p>“Go to it, Stormy,” Robin encouraged. “If it amuses
you, I don’t mind. If you got any more in your system
let’s have it out. Then we’ll go home.”</p>

<p>The gray’s head was up, his ears erect. Robin touched
him lightly with the spurs. Stormy took a step or two.
He had got it out of his system, so to speak, and had
another matter on his mind for the moment.</p>

<p>When Robin’s gaze quite naturally lifted to what attracted
the horse he perceived that all unknown he had
an audience.</p>

<p>A girl sat on a chestnut horse within thirty feet of him,
drawn up against the aspens. She was bareheaded. Her
hair was yellow, like ripe corn, very short, almost as
short as Robin’s. It curled all over her head in little
spirals. She had on a white blouse, a flaming orange
scarf encircled her white throat, her skirt was divided
and of gray corduroy. Her tan riding-boots were armed
with a pair of silver spurs that flashed in the sun and
reminded Robin disagreeably of Mark Steele. She had
big, clear, very dark blue eyes that rested on Robin with
a friendly light in them.</p>

<p>All these details Robin noted in a breath. His hat
was still in his hand. He sat erect in his saddle, staring
in sheer astonishment. He wasn’t used to apparitions
like that. They were rare indeed on the range. He felt
thankful that the whimsicalities he had shouted at Stormy,
the gray horse, in that wild progress across the flat had
not been expressed in the ribald idioms of the cow camps.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” he said politely.</p>

<p>The girl smiled and stepped her horse forward.</p>

<p>“Are you practicing to join Buffalo Bill’s Wild West
Show?” she asked.</p>

<p>Robin grinned.</p>

<p>“Not that you could notice,” said he, cheerfully. “Just
ridin’, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You seem to enjoy it,” she observed.</p>

<p>“Well, if a cow horse tries to throw me and can’t do
it, it don’t make me sad,” Robin admitted.</p>

<p>The gray woke up. He plunged twice, swapped ends
once in the air, stopped as unexpectedly as he began, and
stood fretfully shaking his head. Robin laughed. No
horse ever caught him off guard. The gray sidestepped,
turned so that he exposed the brand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh. You ride for Dan Mayne, do you?” the girl
said. “I’m May Sutherland.”</p>

<p>“Robin Tyler’s my name,” he exchanged the courtesy.
He was not surprised. He had surmised at first glance
that this was Adam Sutherland’s daughter.</p>

<p>“So you’re just riding,” she continued in a friendly
tone. “I do that myself sometimes&#8212;just ride. I thought
cow-punchers always rode for a purpose, not just for fun.
You certainly <i>can</i> ride.”</p>

<p>May Sutherland’s voice was a rather wonderful thing,
it suddenly dawned upon Robin&#8212;and not because she
praised his horsemanship. From that slender figure,
pliant as a willow, a man somehow expected to hear a
sweet, shrill tone, like a canary twittering. May’s voice
was not so much deep, as throaty, liquid. It was like
a caress. It stirred Robin curiously. There rose beside
this very fair, frank-speaking daughter of a cattle king
the image of Ivy Mayne. They were a direct contrast, in
looks, manner, speech, in everything&#8212;and both alluring.
If a man had to choose between them? That vagrant
thought startled Robin. Indeed impressions flashed
through his mind with such speed that those queer speculations
were come and gone without his losing the point
of her words or hesitating for an answer. He was reminded
by her words that he had a very definite purpose
in riding that evening.</p>

<p>“I guess a man generally has something on his mind,
even when he rides for fun,” Robin told her.</p>

<p>He explained briefly why he was riding the gray horse
in the cool of evening, all by himself in that lonely bottom,
and where he was bound. They rode back to the corral.
Stormy was docile now, a very model of high-spirited
gentleness. Robin took the lead rope of his other pony.
They crossed the creek and rode up on the opposite bank
and the range opened before them. The Sutherland ranch
lay in a hollow of the hills, masked by pine timber. The
Bar M Bar was seven miles south, nestled in Little
Birch. Robin could see the contour of the rolling ground
behind his own place.</p>

<p>Away on the farther edge of the westward plains the
sun dipped below the horizon. The Bear Paws loomed
over them on the north, a cluster of high peaks notching
the sky line like the teeth of a huge saw. The canyons
between the mountains were filled with a pearly tinge
slowly turning into the first night shadows. All about
them a great stillness in which crickets chirped&#8212;over
them a sapphire sky with streaks of red and touches
of pale gold in the west.</p>

<p>“Which way you riding?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not riding. I’m looking,” May said in a low
absent tone. “Look!”</p>

<p>She waved a gloved hand in a gesture that swept half
the horizon. Robin looked. He saw far off the dark
line of the Missouri, flanked by the crisscross gashes of
the Bad Lands. He saw far beyond the river the Moccasin
Mountains, the Snowies, the Belts, pale bluish dabs
like so many mirages. He didn’t look for anything in
particular. He didn’t expect to see anything of sensational
import such as a stampeding herd, or vigilantes
pursuing train robbers, or cloud-bursts flooding low
ground nor indeed any of the high lights which in other
times and places are presumed to be shed almost continuously
upon the cattle country. Robin was not obtuse.
He had a dim comprehension of what the girl meant when
she said “Look!” in that low, tense voice. Robin himself
often paused on high ground to look away into those
noble spaces&#8212;to wonder&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>May looked inquiringly at Robin now.</p>

<p>“What do you see away off there?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Room. Lots of room. Room to move around without
knockin’ your elbows against somebody or something
you don’t happen to like. And it’s pretty&#8212;no, that ain’t
the right word. You know what I mean, though, I guess,”
Robin finished lamely. “I like lots of room, myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you mean.” She rested her hand
on the saddle horn before her and her tone was reflective.
“I just wondered if you saw it, or felt it without seeing it.
Space and freedom! Freedom without stint and space
without limit,” she murmured more to herself than to the
cow-puncher beside her. “I wish I were a poet.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes again to Robin with that slow,
faint, friendly smile.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I wondered if you recognized loveliness
when you saw it, or if all this great country only
means to you grass and water for cows. Free pasture.
A chance to make money.”</p>

<p>“Cows,” Robin affirmed, “is part of the game. Nobody
could live on just scenery. But I guess I’d like to look
off across the prairie when the sun’s shining on it anyhow.
It’d be just as good to look at if there wasn’t a
cow in Montana. Only if there was no cattle here, we
wouldn’t be here to look.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, of course,” May admitted. “I wonder
if cow-punchers generally have that feeling about this
country they go galloping over?”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em,” Robin hazarded. “Lots don’t. I’ve
seen a college cow-hand or two that made up poetry about
the range. Most of us haven’t got the education to say
or write what we think. We just whoop when we feel
good over anything and let it go at that. People from
the East reckon we’re part human, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’m not from the East,” May laughed. “I was born
here, within sight of where we sit. And if my father
hadn’t made a lot of money in cattle I’d probably be like
the cowboys&#8212;whoop when I felt good, without knowing
why. As it is&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>Robin turned sidewise in his saddle.</p>

<p>“I expect,” said he, “you’re crammed full of education.
You’ve read all the books in the world. You can talk
like a professor. And play the piano to beat the band.
You’ll marry a French count or an English lord and
live in a castle, and wear silk dresses all the time.”</p>

<p>May rocked in her saddle.</p>

<p>“You’re funny, Robin Tyler,” she chuckled. “Is that
your idea of the proper setting for a cattleman’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“Well, if she’s got thirty thousand cattle behind her
I guess the sky’s the limit,” Robin answered dryly.</p>

<p>“Possibly. Thirty thousand cattle is the important
thing&#8212;in men’s eyes.”</p>

<p>There was something in her tone that made Robin
momentarily uncomfortable. May sat staring off across
the rolling land.</p>

<p>“If you have to go to the Bar M Bar, then back to
the round-up,” she said at last, “you’ll be riding half the
night.”</p>

<p>“That don’t worry me,” Robin returned. “But I
reckon you want to get home before dark, so I’ll drift.”</p>

<p>“I don’t particularly care whether I get home before
dark or not,” she answered. “I don’t have to stand
guard or go on day herd to-morrow. Don’t you sleep
now and then?”</p>

<p>“I can sleep when there’s nothin’ else to do,” Robin
told her. “I wouldn’t waste time sleepin’ if I could sit
on a pinnacle and talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Do you like to talk to me?” she inquired demurely.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The point-blank question, half-amused, half-serious,
stumped Robin. He had more or less impulsively uttered
the truth as it stirred in him at the moment. The “why”
he couldn’t answer, except haltingly. But he did his
best.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, unless it’s because you seem a heap
different from any girl I ever came across,” he replied
honestly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” May inquired smilingly. “I’m
white and past twenty-one. I’ve got hands and feet, a
nose and mouth and hair just like other girls. Where’s
the difference?”</p>

<p>But Robin grew wary of pursuing that inquiry. He
was afraid of getting out of his depth, not too sure she
wasn’t poking fun at him. Girls did that, he knew. He
took refuge in the obvious.</p>

<p>“Your hair’s sure different,” he grinned.</p>

<p>“It is right now,” May admitted calmly. She ran her
fingers through the tangle of short yellow curls. “But
it won’t be by and by&#8212;when it grows again. I was ill.
The fever made it come out. It’s a good cure for vanity
to be bald as an egg, even if only for a little while. Let’s
ride the way you’re going for awhile&#8212;toward the Bar
M Bar.”</p>

<p>Their horses struck a running walk, that untiring gait
of the cow horse trained to cover ground with the least
effort. As they rode May and Robin talked, until on a
low ridge with twilight drawing in the girl pulled up
and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Robin Tyler,” she said. “I wonder when
we’ll meet again.”</p>

<p>“Lord knows,” Robin answered frankly. “If I had
nothing to do but sit on a fat horse and let my feet hang
down you might see more than you wanted to see of me.
But I’m with the round-up until beef-gatherin’s done.
By that time you’ll be gone.”</p>

<p>“No,” May said. “I’m not going any more for awhile,
except when dad goes to Helena or south for the winter.
I’m through school.”</p>

<p>“Got your diploma and everything?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Although I don’t know what good it’s going to
do me. If I’d been a boy I’d be on round-up now, myself.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she asked, as if an afterthought had come,
“you know Mark Steele pretty well, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No.” There was an unavoidable crispness in Robin’s
tone. “I’ve seen him off and on the last three years. I
never worked with him till this fall.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like him, do you?” she observed. Her blue
eyes burrowed into Robin’s.</p>

<p>“I guess I like him as well as he likes me,” Robin said
slowly. He didn’t want to talk about Mark Steele.</p>

<p>“I don’t like him either,” May murmured. “I wouldn’t
trust him as far as I could throw him. Yet my father
thinks he’s the only thing that ever happened around the
Block S.”</p>

<p>Robin sat silent. He could discuss Shining Mark to a
limited extent with Ivy, freely with old man Mayne&#8212;somehow,
not with this girl.</p>

<p>“I hate the man,” she said sharply. “You won’t repeat
what I say?”</p>

<p>“You know I won’t&#8212;or you wouldn’t say it to me,”
Robin told her bluntly. “If you hate him it’s because
you’re afraid of him.”</p>

<p>May looked down at the ground for a second. She
lifted her eyes again to Robin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that’s it? It didn’t occur to me. I have
no reason to be afraid of him. But I find myself wanting
to avoid him although I’ve only met him three or four
times. I rode away from home this evening because my
father expected him at the ranch.”</p>

<p>“I know men in the Bear Paws that walk away around
Mark Steele,” Robin said. “And some that step easy
where he is. Some just naturally don’t like him. Most
everybody figures he’s a bad man to cross. I guess he
knows that, an’ it makes him think quite a heap of himself.
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of him yourself?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’ out loud.” Robin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That’s wisdom. Probably it’s just as well not to
waste either words or thought on Shining Mark Steele.
He’s rather gaudily picturesque, with all those silver
ornaments on him, isn’t he?” she laughed. “Like a stage
cowboy&#8212;only he’s real. By the way, there’s to be a
dance at the schoolhouse above our place next week. One
of the Davis girls told me it was to be timed so our cowpunchers
could take it in when the whole outfit got back
after shipping this herd. Will you be there?”</p>

<p>“If there’s a dance I can get to I’m generally there.
Don’t reckon you will be, though.”</p>

<p>“I might. I’m no snob.”</p>

<p>“I have a sort of idea what that is,” Robin confessed.
“But I’m not dead sure.”</p>

<p>“A snob is one who looks down on persons he deems
of less consequence than himself, and fawns on those he
regards as his superiors, either mentally, socially or financially.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen such.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any in the Sutherland family, thank
God,” May breathed.</p>

<p>“You can sure sling the English language,” Robin said
with a note of admiration in his voice. “Must be a
comfort to know all the words there is to say what you
want, what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it is,” May agreed. “But I imagine things
can be said and pretty well said, and things done, too,
without a great many words.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure,” Robin admitted cheerfully. “Education’s
all right. I got enough school into my system to show
me that. But it won’t do no work by itself. There was
a fellow named Sears in the Black Hills where I was
raised. He was a college man. Talked three languages.
I’ve seen him keep a whole cow outfit quiet for an hour
listening to him when he got tellin’ about things he’d
seen and read and knew about. He should have been
writin’ stories for the magazines. Well, his old man who
was pretty well heeled somewhere east finally died an’
left Sears thirty thousand dollars. First thing he ups
and gets married. Then he got him a ranch and about a
thousand cattle for a starter. In four years he was broke
and his wife run away with a bronco buster from Miles
City. Last I heard of Sears he was punchin’ cows for the
L7 on the lower Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“Does that illustrate the perils of education?” May
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Uh-uh. Not to me. Only that education don’t give
you a cinch. If you got brains and half a chance you
can get an education. If you only got a twice-by-two
skypiece all the schoolin’ in the world won’t land you
on top of the heap.”</p>

<p>“I wonder which crowd I belong to,” May reflected.</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, I wasn’t aimin’ at you,” Robin protested.</p>

<p>“I know you weren’t,” she smiled. “Well, maybe we’ll
continue the discussion at that dance. Good-night.”</p>

<p>This time she was gone, galloping into the twilight.
Robin sat looking after her, listening to the <i>rat-a-pat</i> of
her horse’s hoofs until both sound and rider were swallowed
in the dark.</p>

<p>Then he let Stormy have his head and in half an hour
was dismounting at the Bar M Bar. Lights shone in the
windows. Old Mayne came to the door. Ivy peered
over his shoulder, smiling welcome when the lamplight
showed Robin’s face.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll put these nags in the stable for awhile,”
Robin said, and Mayne brought a lantern.</p>

<p>Sitting on the hewed timber doorsill of the stable
once the horses were munching hay, Robin told his boss
bluntly just what he had seen and what he surmised.</p>

<p>Mayne cursed in impotent fury.</p>

<p>“But it might be worse,” he took heart after a bit.
“We’re gettin’ onto him. I’ll ride them bottoms. You
bet I will. I’ll have to get hold of another cow hand
until you’re through round-up, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Be careful who you get and what you tell him,” Robin
warned. “Steele suspicions me now. He don’t make no
breaks but I know he’s thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was ten years back.” Mayne’s anger rose
again. “I’d ride to the Block S an’ shoot that dirty thief
like I would a mad dog. But the country’s got so God
damned civilized you can’t even kill a thief unless he pulls
a gun on you first. They’d bury me in Deer Lodge for
life. Adam Sutherland’d never let up. He’d spend a
barrel of money to convict a man that shot that pet snake
of his. Don’t you let him provoke you, Robin. If he
thinks you know too much he’ll pick a row with you an’
make you start somethin’. Then he’ll put your light out
an’ it’ll be a clear case of self-defense for him. Or he’ll
make you quit the country.”</p>

<p>Robin didn’t need Mayne to tell him these things. It
was only putting in plain English just what had been
gathering in his own mind&#8212;just what he felt to be the
secret thought Steele nursed. So he didn’t discuss that
phase of it at all. He had said his say, had done his duty.
He rose.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to see Ivy,” he told Mayne. “Then I guess
I’ll split the breeze.”</p>

<p>An hour later he was loping steadily through the night,
Ivy’s farewell kiss on his lips, but with his mind strangely
divided between his sweetheart and May Sutherland.</p>

<p>May was beautiful and so was Ivy Mayne, each in her
own fashion. But May’s liquid, throaty voice lingered
like an echo of faint music in Robin’s ears. Robin was
unread in the nuances of feeling but no man can escape
the subtle thing called charm. May was so utterly free
from archness, little coquetries. She was so honest and
direct. If she had challenged something dormant in him
with all the weapons of her sex, it was an unconscious
challenge.</p>

<p>Spaces and freedom! Robin looked up at the stars
and wondered how she would have described that luminous,
silver-spangled sky, what feelings would have moved her
and what she would have said if she had been riding knee
to knee with him across those rolling plains, guided by
the Big Dipper and an instinctive sense of location. He
knew quite well what Ivy would say, but what she would
feel he doubted if she would know herself, because Ivy
was a curiously dumb soul. Expression was strangled
in her. She could only act, and act often with the driving
impulse terribly obscured. In all their companionship
Robin had been compelled to gauge Ivy’s deepest
thoughts and feelings by outward manifestation alone.</p>

<p>It seemed to Robin a wonderful thing to meet a girl
who could talk in clear simple words about what she
thought and felt about such puzzling sensations as came
over a man when he looked at the vastness and wonder
and mystery of the world he lived in. That quality of
wonder, of space and time in which man danced his little
turn and danced no more, in which there seemed much
disorder but in which there seemed also a Law and a
Pattern and a Purpose if a man could only discover what
it was, had troubled Robin for a long time.</p>

<p>She had been glad to sit there on her horse talking
to him, to ride with him a few miles when she could
just as well have ridden the other way. Robin knew
that May wanted to see him again. She wanted him to
come to that dance. There was no conceit in that certainty.
He felt it. And he was troubled just a little.
He wasn’t sure it would be wise for him. His future, the
immediate future which should logically extend into the
remote, was linked close with Ivy Mayne’s, and as he rode
toward the Block S Robin did not dream of it being
otherwise, did not even harbor the secret wish that it
should be otherwise. He could admire anything that was
lovely without any sense of being fickle or faithless. But
he did have a faint apprehension that it would not be well
for any of them if he should admire May Sutherland too
long or at too close range.</p>

<p>Still, Robin had his due share of masculine curiosity
along with other male virtues and he did wonder why
May seemed to like him. Since most of the mental experience
of his life had been objective rather than introspective
or analytical, it didn’t occur to Robin that
neither wealth nor education nor a considerable knowledge
of the world beyond the cow ranges made any great
difference to a woman’s feelings as regards a man&#8212;not
if that man was young, straight as an arrow, as blithe
as Pan on a holiday and rode like a centaur for sheer
joy of motion. Nor did Robin know that both men and
women liked him for qualities it would have taken a May
Sutherland fresh from a university to grasp and define.
He only knew that people did like him, trusted him&#8212;he
had never felt the venom of ill feeling until he came
up against Mark Steele. Robin had gone joyously up
and down the length of three states without ever drawing
a gun or striking a blow in anger. He had seen both
happen. He had never been so involved. Trouble had
always passed him by until now.</p>

<p>Well, men did go wrong, and the up-and-coming kind
like Mark Steele went to hell with bells on when they did
go wrong. He would have to be careful. And if trouble
came he would have to cope with it as best he could.</p>

<p>That was the philosophic reflection Robin took to bed
with him in the Block S camp somewhere near midnight.</p>

</h2>

<p>Without incident the Block S trailed its bulky herd
across the rolling country between Eagle Creek and Big
Sandy. Late September was on the land. The days were
still and warm, the air full of a tenuous haze. When the
riders went on guard there was a sharp coolness in the
night wind, a harbinger of other nights to come when
they would grumble and wipe the hoar frost from the
seats of their saddles before mounting.</p>

<p>But as yet summer held on. The grass waved yellow
where it grew tall in the foothills, curled like a brown
mat on the wide reach of the plains. Out of these unfenced
pastures the Montana beef herds went to market
daily in their tens of thousands from a score of shipping
points, rolling east to feed a multitude in urban centers
and to fatten the bank accounts of the cattle barons.
To this stream of outgoing stock the Block S added its
quota on a bright autumn day, a week after Robin rode
in the twilight with May Sutherland.</p>

<p>They did not tarry in town. There was a rising market
in Chicago and it was a season of prime beef on the
range. Twenty-four hours after the last steer clicked
his polished horns against the walls of a slatted car the
Block S pitched camp at sundown on Little Eagle, two
miles below the Sutherland ranch. The cowboys were
going to a dance. It was not to interfere with their work.
They would dance instead of sleeping, that was all. A
few hours sleep more or less&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Robin didn’t wait to eat supper. When the last tent
stake was driven he mounted and bore away for home, a
matter of ten miles. Twelve miles from Mayne’s to the
schoolhouse. He would ride that twenty-two miles, dance
all night, take Ivy three miles above the schoolhouse to
a neighbor’s where she could sleep till noon and ride
home at her leisure. He, himself, would get to the roundup
in time to swallow a cup of coffee, catch a fresh horse
and ride again. And he would enjoy every minute of it.
So would Ivy Mayne. Music and a smooth floor. They
both loved dancing. A dance in the summer was rare.
There was always the important seasonal work of the
range in summer. Winter was the time for play. Robin
would not have missed that night’s fun for a month’s pay.
And Ivy would never forgive him if he let her miss it.
She wouldn’t go with any other man, and it wasn’t the
thing in the cow country for nice girls to attend dances
unescorted. So Robin rode his best horse, Red Mike, and
whistled as he burned up the miles.</p>

<p>A little after nine o’clock he was helping Ivy off her
horse. Other saddle ponies, a score of them, were hitched
to the rail fence that kept wild cattle out of the schoolhouse
yard. Buggies and spring wagons loomed in the
darkness. Light shone in the yellow squares from the
windows. No one could ever accuse range folk of taking
their pleasures sadly. Within rose a cheerful clatter of
voices, laughter, the tuneful blend of a fiddle and a piano,
the slither of feet on a floor made smooth by candlescrapings.</p>

<p>They hurried in.</p>

<p>While Ivy went into a sort of side room to change her
riding boots for a pair of slippers carried in her hand,
Robin stood in a short entryway, looking in. As a practiced
cowman sweeps a bunch of stock and at a single
glance notes marks and brands, so he took in the different
faces, most of which he knew&#8212;the Davis girls, from the
ranch nearby where Ivy’s small brother and sister lived
while they attended school, the whole Santerre family
from Sand Creek, a sprinkling of small cowmen and ranchers
from within a radius of twenty miles, even a contingent
from Big Sandy.</p>

<p>Over in one corner, bulking large, his big face rosy
like a rising sun sat Adam Sutherland, one leg crossed
over the other, conversing with another man. Down at
the far end Robin marked two couples just a little different,
very subtly, indefinably so, from the general run
of the crowd gathered for this merry-making. Of the
quartette Robin knew one&#8212;Sutherland’s girl. The other
three, two young men and a girl of twenty, he had never
seen before. They were waltzing. As they came down
the length of the floor May saw Robin in the doorway.
She smiled, nodded over her partner’s shoulder. Just
abreast of him the music ceased. May turned to him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Robin Tyler.”</p>

<p>“Howdy, Miss Sutherland.”</p>

<p>“Let me introduce you&#8212;Mr. Stevens, Mr. Tyler.”</p>

<p>Robin took a second look at young Stevens.</p>

<p>“You happen to be connected with the Long S down
in the Larb Hills country?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, sort of,” young Stevens grinned. “My father’s
outfit. You know anybody with the Long S?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I expect I know some of your men,” Robin said.
“But I wasn’t thinkin’ of that. It just struck me that
it’s kind of funny to come across you. Bob Terry is a
cousin of mine.”</p>

<p>“The dickens he is! Then we’re kin by marriage.
You’re a Texan too, then?”</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“My father was. I was born in the Black Hills; grew
up there.”</p>

<p>“Wonder you never showed up round the Long S.”
Stevens gazed at him. “Or are you on your own here?”</p>

<p>“Uh-uh. Punchin’ cows. I was with Bob one season
over on the Big Dry.”</p>

<p>“You know my sister, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh sure. Liked her a heap, too.”</p>

<p>Young Stevens smiled at May and Robin impartially.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard about Bob Terry chasing all the way
from the Panhandle to kill young Joe Stevens, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>May laughed.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I was a little girl here when it happened.
Is there any one on the range in Montana who hasn’t
heard that story about Bob Terry and young Joe
Stevens? And Mr. Tyler is Bob Terry’s cousin, eh?
Since Joe is your sister, what ‘in-law’ relation does that
make you two?”</p>

<p>“Give it up.”</p>

<p>“Too complicated,” Robin murmured. “I’d have to
go to school some more to figure that out.”</p>

<p>“As usual,” May changed the subject, “there aren’t
enough girls to go around. Did you bring one?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She’s getting organized,” Robin answered.</p>

<p>He looked around. Ivy stood just inside the door of
the little side room looking at him. He beckoned. She
didn’t move, except to lift her hands and finger her hair
with deft little patting touches. The handclapping
brought an encore from the fiddler and the coatless pianist
who pawed the ivory with gay abandon even if his
technique left something to be desired. Stevens and May
went on with their dance. Robin joined Ivy where she
stood. He was impatient to get his feet on that smooth
floor.</p>

<p>“Who was that towhead you were talkin’ to?” she
asked&#8212;it seemed to Robin a trifle resentfully. That
amused him, perhaps even flattered his vanity a trifle. He
had known Ivy to be jealous before on slight grounds,
or none at all.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Adam Sutherland’s girl,” he said carelessly.
“Come on. Let’s dance.”</p>

<p>“I never knew you knew her,” Ivy said.</p>

<p>“I met her once. What’s the odds?”</p>

<p>They moved out on the floor. Mark Steele passed
them with the schoolma’am clasped in his manly arms.
The school-teacher was very good-looking, a vivacious
person with a mass of dark auburn hair and gray eyes
and Mark was supposed to like her rather well. He
smiled and spoke to Ivy over his partner’s shoulder and
Ivy bestowed on Mark her sweetest smile and a pert reply.</p>

<p>Robin looked down at her. Her dark head didn’t come
more than halfway up his breast, so he couldn’t see her
eyes. But he felt a strange stiffness in her attitude, a
resentment. Robin had a faculty of gauging Ivy’s moods
without a word from her. Almost at once the anticipated
pleasure of the evening began to wane. Ivy was
sore because he knew May Sutherland well enough to
speak to her. She would go out of her way to make him
feel her displeasure. She would want to hurt him, and she
would be extremely nice to Mark Steele, or some other
man, just to spite him. More than likely she would choose
to use Steele as a foil. With what Robin knew of Mark’s
raiding Mayne’s stock and Mark’s attitude toward himself
Robin foresaw some unpleasant moments ahead. For
a fleeting instant he wished he hadn’t come. Then he felt
ashamed of himself for such a weakness, annoyed at anticipation
of trouble and a wish to avoid it. Time enough
to worry when trouble lifted its ugly head.</p>

<p>“Floor’s good,” he remarked to Ivy. “I feel like I had
wings on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she drawled with a rising inflection. “Look out
you don’t fly too high.”</p>

<p>“Wha’s a molla, hon?” he wheedled. “You’re not goin’
to have a grouch about nothin’, are you?”</p>

<p>Ivy looked up at him. It happened that at that precise
instant Robin’s gaze was on May and her partner.
Ivy’s dark eyes glowed.</p>

<p>“I will if you dance with that stuck-up thing,” she
whispered tensely. “Promise me you won’t.”</p>

<p>“Ivy,” he protested. “What the dickens has got into
you all at once?”</p>

<p>“She thinks she’s so darned smart,” Ivy muttered.</p>

<p>Robin had fully intended to dance with May Sutherland
because dancing with her would afford the only
opportunity they would have to talk and he had scarcely
realized how eager he was to talk to May Sutherland
until Ivy began taking measures to forestall anything of
the kind. Robin was both irritated and puzzled. But he
had a nimble wit and a touch of diplomacy. He was willing
to concede a point, to make a concession.</p>

<p>“If I give her the go-by will you promise not to dance
with Mark Steele?”</p>

<p>“Why, how can I,” Ivy manifested surprise, “if he
asks me?”</p>

<p>“You can tell him you got another partner,” Robin
suggested, “or say you’re tired. Any darned fool thing
girls say when they don’t want to dance with a man.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” Ivy declared.</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t. What’s the difference in you
dancin’ with Shinin’ Mark when you know I’d rather you
wouldn’t and me dancin’ with Miss Sutherland?”</p>

<p>Robin kept his tone gentle although he had an impulse
to shake soundly this morsel of perverse prettiness he held
in his arms. He even managed to get a jocular note
into what he said.</p>

<p>“Lots of difference. I’ve often danced with Mark. You
never kicked. You never said you didn’t want me to
dance with him.”</p>

<p>Robin was dumb. He couldn’t tell Ivy why. He
couldn’t explain to her that he had never liked Mark
Steele, nor why that dislike had suddenly become acute.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said unhappily, “what’s fair for one ought
to be fair for the other. If you’re dead set on being
mean, go ahead.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will dance with her?” the storm tone
was growing in Ivy’s voice.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I was going to.”</p>

<p>“I know you. You never do anything I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the Lord’s sake let’s not spoil this with a
row,” Robin pleaded. “You know darned well I love you
too much to bother my head about any other girl.
What’s wrong with May Sutherland more than any other
girl here? You never asked me not to dance with Minnie
Davis nor Bessie Santerre nor the school-teacher.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like her. I don’t like the way she looked at
you,” Ivy muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>“Neither do I like the way Mark Steele looks at you,
old girl,” Robin lowered his voice. “And he looks at you
that way every time he’s around you. I never kicked
about it before. I never acted like I wanted to put you
in a glass case. I give you credit for havin’ sense about
men.”</p>

<p>“Aw, pouf!”</p>

<p>There was an angry finality in Ivy’s exclamation.
They finished the waltz in silence and it was not a particularly
enjoyable Terpsichorean effort for Robin Tyler.
When they sat down he tried to talk about different
matters but Ivy confined herself to “yes” or “no” or an
occasional sarcastic “you don’t say” until Robin gave
up in despair. When the music began again Mark Steele
slid across the floor and Ivy rose to dance with him.
There was a defiant sidelong flicker in her eyes toward
Robin as she got up.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to go outside and smoke a cigarette.
Robin was disturbed and uneasy and resentful.
He knew that was no frame of mind for dancing. The
night, the stars, and a cigarette would drive that mood
away. Like a wounded animal Robin instinctively sought
solitude when he was hurt. All his minor victories over
whatever griefs and disappointment had come his way
had been won by thinking it out alone, on the plains, in
lonely camps, in night watches under a quiet sky.</p>

<p>But as Robin rose to go his glance, taking in the room,
fell upon May, sitting by her father. She was looking
squarely at him. Moreover, from the other side of the
room a large, ungainly stock hand from the head of Sand
Creek, who had taken one drink too many before he
came to the dance, was staring earnestly at May, evidently
meditating descent, since she was the only woman
not already on the floor.</p>

<p>Robin’s mood changed in the flick of an eyelash. If
Ivy wanted to&#8212;well, let her! He strode over to May.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to beat a retreat,” she murmured,
when they were on the floor. “You aren’t shy,
are you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know me very well,” Robin replied. “The
only time you ever saw me I didn’t act very shy, did I?”</p>

<p>“That was different,” she laughed. “A cow-puncher
on a horse, on his own ground&#8212;that <i>is</i> different. Some
of these nice-looking boys act as if they weren’t sure it
was safe to approach me.”</p>

<p>“A fellow hates to get turned down,” Robin observed.
“You’re a big, strange toad in the puddle&#8212;oh, darn it,
I didn’t mean that.”</p>

<p>“It’s a perfectly proper simile,” she hastened to assure
him. “I know what you mean. I am. But no one need
be afraid of splashing me. I like to dance. I like fun as
well as any other girl in these hills.”</p>

<p>“I expect you do,” Robin somehow found it easy to
talk to her. “But you cut a lot of ice in this country,
or your dad does, and it’s the same thing. I expect after
the kind of dances you’re used to and the people you’ve
lived among this don’t exactly look like no Fourth of
July celebration to you. A cow-puncher may be wild
and woolly but he’s no fool. He knows when he’s outclassed&#8212;as
far as a girl is concerned.”</p>

<p>“You are a rather wide-awake young man in some
respects,” she said thoughtfully. Then after a momentary
silence she changed the subject. “Who is the
pretty little dark-haired girl you brought?”</p>

<p>“That’s Ivy Mayne.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s Ivy. She doesn’t seem to know me.
Well, I don’t suppose she would.”</p>

<p>“You know Ivy?” Robin pricked up his ears. He had
never heard Ivy so much as mention May Sutherland.</p>

<p>“Why, we began school together right here in this
room. At least I had been going a couple of years when
Ivy commenced. There were only six pupils. I attended
this school until I was twelve. Then I went away to
boarding school.”</p>

<p>“Were you two chummy at all?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>May wrinkled her brows slightly.</p>

<p>“It seems to me we agreed to disagree on various occasions,”
she replied. “I was a good deal of a spitfire in
those days. If I remember correctly I used to flare up
and then Ivy would sulk. What silly things girls do
when they’re kids,” she laughed reminiscently. “I
shouldn’t have known her. She’s awfully good looking,
isn’t she? Perfect features and beautiful eyes. How
has she escaped capture here in the Bear Paws where
there are six men for every woman? Dad says no schoolteacher
has ever taught more than a single term. They
always get married. How has Ivy kept her freedom?”</p>

<p>“Hard to catch, I guess,” Robin made a noncommittal
reply.</p>

<p>He did not say that he had tentatively captured Ivy.
Here, to-night, for the first time in the six months they
had been formally engaged he had a doubt of his capture
being complete. And besides that doubt he did not
want to talk about Ivy Mayne to this fair-haired girl
who floated in his clasp light as a feather.</p>

<p>When that dance ended May left him to go straight
to Ivy. Robin saw her shake hands and sit down beside
Dan Mayne’s daughter and talk with a gracious smile.
He didn’t stay to see the outcome of that. He was a
little uneasy. He knew Ivy. She could be gracious when
she chose, but she could also be very difficult with members
of her own sex. Robin let his desire for a smoke
take him outside. There, as he leaned against the building
he overheard a snatch of conversation just around
the corner. He knew one of the voices&#8212;Tex Matthews.
The other was strange. Robin would have moved instantly,
but the first sentence held him.</p>

<p>“Who was the good-lookin’ kid dancin’ with Sutherland’s
daughter. I don’t mean young Stevens or the
other one&#8212;the boy with the wavy hair?”</p>

<p>“Robin Tyler. You know&#8212;I told you.”</p>

<p>“I see. An’ that was his girl Shinin’ danced with.
Say, they make well-matched couples paired that way,
eh? Looked to me like the blond princess likes the kid.
An’ I don’t reckon the red-headed school-teacher better
be too sure of Mark, eh? Two pair, queens up.”</p>

<p>The man chuckled at his fancy.</p>

<p>“Queens all right,” Matthews drawled. “Well, I’ve
seen two pair, queens up, hard to beat before now.”</p>

<p>“Old Adam Sutherland could beat any two pair in the
deck with an ace in the hole, the way he’s fixed,” the
other man laughed. “I don’t suppose old Adam aims
his girl to marry no common cow hand. Still, you never
can tell. I’d play that curly-headed kid for a king any
time.”</p>

<p>“And the other one’s a jack&#8212;a measly jack,”
Matthews said harshly. “Remember that old jingle
‘The queen of hearts, she made some tarts upon a summer
day. The jack of hearts, he stole those tarts and carried
them away.’ Well&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Say,” the other man lowered his voice discreetly,
“don’t talk like that out loud, Tex. Cracks like that
can make trouble. I guess we better not hit that bottle
again.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t whisky made me say that,” Tex replied.
“And I don’t ever talk in my sleep. There won’t be no
trouble until&#8212;well, until I know better where we’re at.
Then maybe I’ll start her myself.”</p>

<p>Robin withdrew softly, a little ashamed for listening,
a little disturbed by what he had heard&#8212;and puzzled also
by the last exchange of sentences. But it seemed to have
no bearing on his affairs. There was a two-step playing
now and Robin sought a partner.</p>

<p>By midnight he had been unable to claim more than a
couple of dances from Ivy and these she quite patently
danced under protest, refusing to smile at him, scarcely
condescending to talk. This sullen resentment she kept
for him alone. With every other man she was bright as
new-minted gold, even gay. And she danced oftenest
of all with Mark Steele. Slowly there grew in Robin’s
breast a curiously mingled ache and anger. She wouldn’t
play fair and he was impotent to do anything about it.</p>

<p>For the supper dance Ivy flatly turned him down.</p>

<p>“Go dance it with May Sutherland,” she said tartly.
“I got a partner.”</p>

<p>“What you tryin’ to do to me, Ivy?” he asked soberly.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ at all. I’m just having a good time. Isn’t
that what we come to a dance for?”</p>

<p>Go dance it with May Sutherland! All right, Robin
said to himself. He would&#8212;if he could. If it was to be
everybody for himself and the devil take the hindmost,
why not be in the van? He knew what partner Ivy meant.
He knew what construction every man and woman there
would put on Ivy’s eating supper with Shining Mark.
They would infer that Mark had cut him out, and there
would be just the faintest anticipation of trouble. Robin
grimly promised to fool them there. He would never
jump Mark Steele over a woman’s fickle whim. If Ivy
was fool enough to throw herself at Shining Mark in a fit
of groundless jealousy&#8212;she could! No, if and when he
clashed with Mark Steele it would be over something more
serious than a girl’s favor.</p>

<p>So Robin stood by and when Mark did claim Ivy for
the supper dance he looked about for May. On second
thought he expected to find her dancing with young
Stevens or young Harper. But Stevens was paired with
Miss Rose Barton and young Harper had appropriated
the auburn-haired school-teacher. Robin had in the
course of the evening been introduced to all three. He
had danced with Rose, a gay and lightsome damsel from
Helena, who confided to Robin that she had come there
in some trepidation since she had never before seen the
cowboy on his native heath. Having been told sundry
tales by Adam Sutherland and young Stevens she half
expected the Block S riders to take the floor in woolly
chaps and jingling spurs, to make the welkin ring with
shouts and perhaps occasionally fire a shot through the
roof in their unrestrained exuberance.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” Robin had sympathized mockingly. “And
you find us a tame outfit wearin’ store clothes and collars
and patent leather shoes and actin’ like anybody at any
ordinary dance. Maybe some of the boys might put on
a little wild west specially for your benefit if you mentioned
it.”</p>

<p>But Miss Barton hastened to assure him that she
wanted no such displays. The Block S men were good
dancers. She liked cow-punchers, she informed him
archly, if several of those present were a fair sample.</p>

<p>For the moment the rest of the Sutherland crowd had
vanished. He didn’t see Adam anywhere. Looking about
he got a flash of May in the lean-to helping two or three
older women arrange sandwiches on platters. The smell
of coffee floated out of this room.</p>

<p>Robin went outside. He didn’t want to dance. He
didn’t want to eat. He was acutely uncomfortable. He
boiled within and the accumulated pressure of emotion
was a long time yielding to the solace of tobacco and the
quiet night. Under the dusky pines, the high hills that
walled in the little valley, the soundless velvet sky, Robin
presently regained his poise. He knew Ivy through and
through. She was acting like a fool. She knew it and to-morrow
or the next day she would be sorrowful and
contrite. Since he could never hold a grudge against
her it would be all right. No use getting all “het up,”
as old Mayne would say. Robin was no philosopher.
But he did have certain qualities of mind which made
him patient, resourceful, an unconscious practitioner of
the saying that what cannot be cured must be endured.
He could wait and hold on, without losing heart.</p>

<p>The lilt of the fiddle and the thump of the piano presently
apprised him that supper was over. He thought
he might as well go in. There was a chilly comfort in
the reflection that no one would have missed him, or wondered
where he was. So he lingered to smoke another
cigarette. Strangely his mental images were not of Ivy
and Shining, nor of May Sutherland, nor indeed of anything
pertaining to the night and the hour. His mind
went back to the day he lamed Stormy by Cold Spring
and what he saw in the Birch Creek bottom. He thought
of cows dead of sudden death, of stolen calves, of many
other trifling incidents which somehow all seemed to be
falling into a definite sequence that must lead to some
sort of climax in which he was bound to be involved. He
knew what desperate chances rustlers take once they
embark on the quick road to a bigger herd than comes by
natural growth. Theft led to killing, as the cornered
highwayman kills. That was the history of the cattle
thief all the way from the Staked Plains to the forty-ninth
parallel. Robin wondered where this unlawful venture
of Mark Steele’s was going to lead all of them, more
particularly himself. He knew, moreover, as matters
stood, that if Ivy gave Mark Steele a definite impression
that she could be his for the taking&#8212;and Mark wanted
her&#8212;he and Mark Steele couldn’t live in the same country.
It wasn’t big enough.</p>

<p>He threw away his cigarette and went back to the
schoolhouse. There was a quicker tempo in evidence.
There had been three or four bottles of whisky cached
around outside. No one was drunk, but high spirits were
being more freely manifested. That was a custom of the
country, seldom lacking observance.</p>

<p>In the entry-way, a sort of lobby, Robin met Ivy. She
had on her riding boots and coat.</p>

<p>“You going now?” he said in surprise. “Wait till I
get my hat.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she answered stiffly. “Mr. Steele is
going to take me up to Davis’s.”</p>

<p>For a breath Robin literally saw red, a red mist that
momentarily fogged his vision. By an effort he shook
that off. That gust of unreasoning fury had a double
effect. It was like a physical pain&#8212;and it frightened
him. He understood in that moment why men strangely
run amuck. Yet in one corner of his brain a small, weak
voice seemed to be saying, “Don’t act like a damn fool.
Don’t act like a damn fool.”</p>

<p>He forced himself to say with a smile, “Oh, all right.”</p>

<p>Then Steele appeared, hat in hand, jaunty. He flashed
a look that Robin read as amused triumph&#8212;and Robin
let that pass.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he said to Ivy quite casually and
went on in, straight to where he saw May Sutherland
talking to another girl. He wouldn’t give either Ivy or
Steele the satisfaction of looking back, though he knew
instinctively that both were watching him while Mark
leaned against the wall buckling on his silver spurs.</p>

<p>“Will you dance this?” Robin asked May.</p>

<p>She didn’t say she would. She rose with a faint smile
and put her hand on his arm. As they turned the first
corner of the room Robin saw the other two pass out,
Ivy flinging a last glance over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“If they think I’m going to care a curse&#8212;&#8212;” he
didn’t finish the sentence in his mind. It wasn’t true.
He did care. His pride as well as his affection was involved
in that episode. Any other man but Shining Mark!
Then he put it resolutely aside and talked to May.</p>

<p>“I’m going home after this number,” May told him
presently. “Some of these men have had one drink too
many. I’m a little bit tired. I’ve danced everything but
the supper dance.”</p>

<p>“They do get lit up once in a while,” Robin admitted.
“How did you come? Buggy?”</p>

<p>“No, we all rode up. Dad and Bill Harper went home
before supper. Billy doesn’t care much about dancing,
and I think he had a little tiff with Rose.”</p>

<p>“I’m about ready to go myself,” Robin said. “I’ll
ride down with you if you like.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you bring a girl?” May looked at him curiously.
“Isn’t it proper to take <i>her</i> home?”</p>

<p>“Sure. But she’s gone home already,” Robin answered
evenly, “with another wild cowboy.”</p>

<p>May said nothing to that for a minute. Then: “All
right, if you <i>are</i> going. Rose and Joe are having too
good a time to leave yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find your horse and bring him to the door.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. It’s the chestnut I rode the other day. Will
you know him?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I’d know your saddle anyhow, by those funny
little <i>tapaderos</i>.”</p>

<p>The music stopped. Robin got his hat and went out.
When he led the two horses to the steps in front May was
waiting. Rose Barton and Ed Stevens were with her.
Three or four other dancers had come out for a breath
of air. They stood chatting and laughing in the light
from the open doorway. Robin suspected that tongues
would wag freely about himself and Mark Steele and Ivy
and May. But he didn’t care&#8212;if May didn’t. It struck
him that probably May would never know that people
were wagging their tongues, and that she would only be
amused if she did know. If a king&#8212;whether a king in
cattleland or a monarch by right divine&#8212;could do no
wrong, a king’s daughter wore no lesser mantle.</p>

<p>“Take care you don’t get lost,” Rose Barton teased.
“You’ll see that bandits don’t carry her off and hold her
for ransom, won’t you, Mr. Tyler?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure,” Robin flung back, as he swung into his
saddle. “If we meet up with outlaws I’ll be the cowboy
hero. Good-night, everybody.”</p>

<p>They rode down that dark creek bottom. Little Eagle
muttered in its pebbly channel between lines of drooping
willow. Smells of pine came down from hills black against
the paler sky. They rode silently, side by side, each
seeing the other’s face as a pale blur in the darkness.</p>

<p>It wasn’t far to the Block S. They crossed a horse
pasture, came into another enclosure where loomed a
diversity of dim buildings, a great monument of a barn.
Beyond these on a little knoll rose the king’s castle, a
one-story structure sprawling in three wings added from
time to time in the last fifteen years as the Sutherland
fortunes expanded. A light glowed in one window.</p>

<p>“Have a good time?” Robin asked when they dismounted.</p>

<p>“Oh, splendid,” she murmured. “Everybody seemed to
enjoy it so.”</p>

<p>“They generally do.”</p>

<p>“And I was lucky besides,” May laughed. “I got
through the whole evening without having to dance with
the Block S range foreman. I wonder if that man affects
anybody else the way he does me? When I look at him
I’d as soon have a snake touch me. It’s queer.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s others don’t like him much,” Robin
agreed. “And I don’t suppose he cares. Will I put your
horse in the barn, Miss Sutherland?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, don’t bother. Just lay the saddle by the
steps and turn him loose.”</p>

<p>Robin did so. May stood by until the chestnut went
free.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you want to get in your little trundle
bed.” Robin lifted his hat. “So, I’ll ramble.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said May softly. “Take care of yourself,
Robin Tyler. Don’t let any bad horses fall on you
so you won’t be able to go to dances in the Bear Paws
this winter.”</p>

<p>“No fear,” Robin shook the extended hand and turned
to his stirrup. “It won’t be bad horses that’ll keep me
from dancin’. Good-night.”</p>

<p>In twenty minutes Robin was in his blankets, in a camp
still all but deserted. Sleep came slowly. When he did
fall asleep he dreamed a lot of fantastic stuff in which
Mark Steele, Ivy, himself, May Sutherland, dead cows,
lonely sage-grown bottoms, herds of T Bar S’s and
dancing couples mixed and whirled in a disorderly fantasy.
And somehow he seemed to move amid these scenes
and persons with his hands tied behind his back, the sport
of all the others.</p>

<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER IX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>A DIFFERENT SORT OF DANCE</span>
</h2>

<p>The first circle the Block S made the next morning
covered that portion of the Range between the home
ranch and Shadow Butte. Afternoon saw the outfit
camped on Little Birch a gunshot above Robin’s homestead.
That evening Steele assigned him to “cocktail”,
range slang for the short watch on herd between supper
and dusk. Then he was slated for middle guard. Even
if he had desired to ride down and see Ivy, Robin had
no time. He was not sure he should go. Ivy’s anger did
not always evaporate like mist in the brightness of her
lover’s smile. In another day or two she might be able
to laugh at that tantrum. To-night the sun might still
be setting on her wrath.</p>

<p>When they rode at dawn they passed within a hundred
yards of the house. That afternoon the chuck wagon
rolled down Birch to a point near Cold Spring. For four
days the Block S worked in the heart of Dan Mayne’s
range, without Mayne once appearing at the round-up.
Usually when the outfit worked his territory the old man
rode with them. Robin guessed that Mayne kept away because
he couldn’t stand close contact with the man who
was stealing his stock. Anyway Robin had his
instructions and he knew marketable beef when he saw it.
A third of the cattle in each round-up carried the Bar M
Bar. Robin cut over a hundred prime beeves into the
day herd for shipment.</p>

<p>Well below Cold Spring a sprinkling of T Bar S stuff
began to show. There was no shipping beef in that
brand. But every cow had her calf marked. Once or
twice Robin noted a T Bar S calf without a mother, a
little bit lean and scraggly&#8212;orphans. There would be
others, he surmised, which he did not see. One man
couldn’t see everything over a territory fifty miles wide
and a hundred miles long. Not once in that region did
he spot a Bar M Bar cow with an unbranded calf at side.
Nor did Robin again have opportunity to see what Steele
and Thatcher did when they took the outside circle by
themselves. That happened less often. Robin knew
Steele would be wary now anywhere within a few miles of
the Mayne ranch. The man might take long chances but
he was not a fool.</p>

<p>As they worked east of Chase Hill the T Bar S cattle
grew more plentiful.</p>

<p>“For a man who lives in Helena, who don’t have no
rider, who don’t ever show up himself, this here Jim Bond
sure gets his stock well looked after,” Tex Matthews remarked
to Robin one day. “He’ll do well in the cow
business, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“How?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>Tex shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t know you, kid, I might think maybe you
were asleep. There’s awful good care took in this country
to see that all Jim Bond’s calves get branded.”</p>

<p>There was a slight emphasis on the “all.”</p>

<p>“You don’t reckon he gets branded for him more’n the
law allows?” Robin hazarded.</p>

<p>The Texan looked hard at him for a second. Then he
smiled.</p>

<p>“If it was anything to me; if I had stock in these parts,
I’d be mighty curious about this T Bar S,” he drawled.
“I sure would. As it is, it ain’t a Block S man’s business
to be curious about anything but Block S stuff.”</p>

<p>“Even if Block S calves should happen to grow a T
Bar S on their ribs?”</p>

<p>The Texan sat sidewise in his saddle and gazed at
Robin with a faint uplift at one corner of his thin lips.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked with seeming irrelevance, “I
reckon the Bar M Bar ‘rep’ don’t go to sleep at the switch.
Say, did you ever know a man get ambitious and figure
out wise little schemes to make him rich off his neighbors?”</p>

<p>“Seems like I’ve heard of such.”</p>

<p>“So’ve I. I have an idea somebody not a million miles
away might know more about this T Bar S than we do.
No, sir. I shouldn’t be surprised. Only,” he added
thoughtfully, “you needn’t mention I said so.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t a great hand at mentionin’,” Robin grunted.
“You know that.”</p>

<p>“Old Jim Bond, he’s supposed to turn a hundred and
fifty head of stuff south of the Bear Paws a year ago
last spring,” Matthews rambled on. “I guess a man
don’t make no fortune out of a one-horse saloon in
Helena. Now wouldn’t it be fine for old Jim if his stock
doubled in a year, and kept on. At that rate in five years
or so he’d be quite a cowman. Only I have a sort of
hunch that in a good deal less’n five years somebody else’ll
own the T Bar S.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll it be?” Robin asked idly.</p>

<p>They were sitting on a rise of ground that overlooked
a southward bend of the Missouri, waiting for the last
drive to come into the round-up.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t sure. But I could give a guess. So
could you.”</p>

<p>“In five years,” Robin prophesied, “Adam Sutherland’ll
own the T Bar S&#8212;or it won’t be used on cows.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, maybe so,” Tex said. “I expect somebody’ll
be surprised when old Adam decides to own the
T Bar S, though.”</p>

<p>“What you gettin’ at, Tex?” Robin demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>“Just passin’ the time in talk,” Matthews drawled.
“Say, did you never pack a six-gun.”</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“I never even owned one.”</p>

<p>“How come you never did? First kid I ever saw on
the range that didn’t like to play with a pistol.”</p>

<p>“Never took much to it,” Robin told him. “My old
man was killed in a gun play when I was about ten. My
mother was dead set against burnin’ powder. She’d seen
too much of it. She was a Terry. Seems like the Tylers
and Terrys have thrown lots of lead down South where
she come from. She kinda discouraged me packin’ a
pistol. She used to say that if I ever needed one bad
enough I could get it when it was wanted. When I started
to ride I never thought much about a six-pistol. Never
needed one. I carry a rifle in the winter for wolves, and
I’ve hunted deer an’ antelope quite a lot. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just wondered. You’re a good-natured, easy-goin’
jasper that laughs trouble away. But what’d you
do if some bad <i>hombre</i> jumped you out of pure cussedness
and started to make a monkey outa you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Never had that happen.” The idea
amused Robin slightly. He laughed. “I’ve been around
a few bad actors. I never seen any of ’em jump a man
who wasn’t armed and kinda sorta ready for trouble&#8212;not
without some good reason.”</p>

<p>“Some men’s reasons for startin’ trouble ain’t known
to nobody but themselves,” Tex observed. “But they stir
her up just the same.”</p>

<p>Matthews’ last sentence recurred to Robin as being
almost prophetic before the afternoon was over. The
riders had swept a range where stock was thick. They
had bunched over a thousand head and were cutting beef
on three sides in swirls of dust. Twilight would be on
them before the last steer was separated from that milling
herd. They had worked at top speed for two months.
Now at the end of a hard day both horses and men were
tired and short-tempered. They rode fast and silently,
without smiles or laughter.</p>

<p>Robin was well mounted. Energetic and alert he held
his own wherever he found himself, but a continuous
darting of steers from the herd to the cut had kept him
so steadily on the jump that when a lull came he let his
horse stand and sat rolling himself a cigarette.</p>

<p>Steele shot an animal out of the herd. The brute
went at a swinging trot and Steele pulled up. Then the
beast suddenly changed its bovine mind and charged
back. Steele laid his horse alongside. The animal
dodged this way and that. Headed on each attempt by
an active cutting horse the steer finally joined his fellows
in the cut. Robin sat still and watched. It was nothing.
If it had been a little nearer he might have taken the
animal off Steele’s hands and left him free to cut out
another. Such an action was not compulsory. On the
other side of the herd these dodging contests were
occurring every minute or two. But Steele reined up
beside him.</p>

<p>“Wake up and ride, you &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;!” he snarled in a tone
so low Robin knew Steele intended no one but himself
should hear. “Think all you got to do is be an ornament?”</p>

<p>The epithet amazed Robin. It came out of the blue.
His face flamed. Before he could open his mouth Steele
dashed back into the herd.</p>

<p>Robin gasped. His first impulse was to spur his
horse after Shining Mark. No man could take that.
Those were fighting words. Yet Steele wasn’t making a
war talk or he would have shouted so that every man
could hear and there would have been no avoiding the
issue. Robin’s brain worked fast. He knew that Steele
was quite calm and collected. What he said he said deliberately,
with a considered purpose.</p>

<p>“You’re lookin’ for trouble,” Robin said thoughtfully.
“But you aim to make <i>me</i> start it. I <i>sabe</i> your play.
You’ll have to try again. I won’t give you no openin’.”</p>

<p>Twice in the next three days Steele dug into Robin.
Each time they were out of earshot of any rider. Each
time Shining Mark flayed him with insult, with provocative
abuse. The second time Robin said quietly:</p>

<p>“You’re wastin’ ammunition, Mark. You can’t kill
me with a blank cartridge. Why don’t you make these
fighting talks before the outfit?”</p>

<p>Shining Mark looked him coldly in the eye.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” said he. “What’ll you do then?”</p>

<p>“Whatever I do everybody’ll know you got it in for
me and forced the play,” Robin told him. “You’ll never
start me smokin’ you up by whispering nasty remarks in
my ear. I don’t give a damn what you say to me under
your breath. <i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>Steele sidled his horse up close beside Robin. He leaned
forward.</p>

<p>“You’re yellow,” he said, with a sneer. “Yellow clear
through. You know you are. I can take your girl away
from you, spit in your face, and you’re afraid to make a
break. When I get through with you a sheep herder
could make you step sideways every time he blatted at
you. I’ll make you jump at your own shadow.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be too sure of that if I was you,” Robin
drawled. A most unnatural calm seemed to possess him.
He felt rather indifferent to Steele’s venomous abuse.
Any feeling Shining Mark betrayed was mere simulation.
Every move he made, every word he uttered was calculated,
part of a design. Its effect on Robin was to make
him wary, watchful. If there had been any real passion
in Steele’s attitude some spark in Robin would have
matched it in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap,” Robin continued. “You’re pretty
small potatoes, it strikes me, to shoot off your face the
way you do when you’ve got a gun on your hip and I
haven’t. You’re the yellow dog, it strikes me.”</p>

<p>“You can always heel yourself,” Mark suggested.</p>

<p>“Why are you so keen to have me make a break at
you?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>“So I can kill you,” Mark returned. “I don’t like
you.”</p>

<p>“If you kill everybody you don’t like,” Robin curled
his lip, “you sure must have a big graveyard. Where do
you bury your dead, anyway?”</p>

<p>He laughed in Steele’s face and Shining’s thin, handsome
features grew dark with a genuine scowl.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you laugh on the other side of your face,”
he snapped. “You watch my smoke. Before the snow
flies I’ll get you.”</p>

<p>“I hear you,” Robin taunted. “You sound like the
buzzing of a mosquito to me.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can always quit the country,” Mark
said significantly, and swung his horse away in a lope.</p>

<p>So that was it! Robin sat looking after the Block S
range boss. He had thought himself cool and he found
that he was shaking with anger and he knew that his face
was white. Probably Shining Mark thought those were
the signs of a man who was getting the fear of God put
in his heart. So <i>that</i> was the play. Put fear into him
so that he would quit the Bar M Bar, quit the country.
Men had shifted ranges before now to avoid trouble with
a potential killer. Steele was all that. Robin didn’t
doubt that Shining Mark would make his word good. He
had made other men walk around him by virtue of some
inner force to which weaker spirits submitted. Robin had
recognized that dynamic quality long before he had
dreamed of a personal clash with Mark Steele.</p>

<p>But he did not believe that Mark had reached the
stage where he considered it necessary to bushwhack him.
His personal safety necessitated Robin Tyler’s mouth
being stopped from mentioning cows dead of sudden death
and calves stealthily branded. Robin did not believe
Steele had yet reached the point where he would deliberately
pick a row in public&#8212;force him to burn powder.
That would be too raw. That in itself would arouse a
curiosity as to what fire lay behind the smoke. Steele’s
game seemed clear to Robin. It was simply to treat him
like any other man in public and privately to goad him
beyond all endurance until in desperation he belted on a
six-shooter and started something. Whereupon in self-defense
Mark would kill him in a workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>Mark was deadly with a six-shooter. He had killed
nothing but badgers, prairie dogs and the ubiquitous tin
can with his belt-gun since he had been with the Block S.
But he had potted whatsoever he shot at with a skill and
precision which argued long practice. He was fast on
the draw. He shot as a man throws a stone, with instinctive
rather than measured aim. Perhaps one range
rider in a hundred ever developed that perfect coördination
of hand and eye with a .45 Colt. The man who had
it&#8212;along with unquestioned courage&#8212;could be reasonably
assured of respectful consideration from his fellows.</p>

<p>No, Robin told himself, he would not walk into <i>that</i>
trap.</p>
</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chX' title="X—A WORD AND A BLOW">
<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>A WORD AND A BLOW</span>
</h2>

<p>No man can altogether escape the dominant influences
of his environment. For good or evil his thought and
action must be colored by the thought and action of his
fellows, as his speech will be colored by the current
idioms.</p>

<p>Robin, in spite of his resolution not to be snared in
the net Mark Steele spread for his feet, found himself
seething internally, found himself suffering all the agonies
of shame for indignities unresented, passed over in silence.
Steele did his best to make his life a misery during the
few days it took the Block S to move its beef herd within
sight of the Big Sandy stockyards. The man was moved
by a definite policy born of cunning and craftily put into
effect. At no time did he really overstep that limit which
would have brought his crew up standing in expectation
of an open clash. He said nothing, did nothing openly
that would have been impossible for Robin to let go by.
But he shaved close. Robin knew that every man in the
outfit was wondering just a little, scenting some sort
of hidden animosity between the two. Steele was curt,
peremptory, oblique, before the outfit. But whenever
he caught Robin alone he taunted him, abused him with
a venom that would have been unendurable if Robin
had not known it as part of a calculated plan.</p>

<p>He took it all, outwardly unruffled, inwardly approaching
the volcanic state. He could afford to let Steele think
his tactics would bear fruit&#8212;that in the language of the
range he had young Tyler buffaloed. He could afford
to let Steele think he was afraid. Perhaps he was.
Robin was not ashamed to admit to himself that he might
be afraid. He did not desire to commit suicide. To
grab anybody’s gun and match himself against Shining
Mark was the equivalent of self-destruction.</p>

<p>There was neither satisfaction nor glory in being shot
by a cow thief merely because a cow thief considered that
a good way to cover up his tracks. Yet short of killing
Steele or being killed by him Robin could see no way out
of this predicament except the unthinkable one Mark had
suggested&#8212;that he quit the country. He might be
afraid to tackle Steele but he was not sufficiently afraid
to run. If he did not run Mark would eventually force
him to burn powder. Robin could see that clearly enough.
And the onus would be on him, his blood would be upon
his own head, to all outward appearances. Steele was
seeing cleverly to that. By every artifice in his repertoire
he was putting Robin in the position of having to
force the issue or feel himself in reality what Mark contemptuously
said he was&#8212;a yellow dog.</p>

<p>So matters stood when the herd was trimmed and the
cattle loaded. The outfit was to lie there on the Big
Sandy flats for a day or two. Shipping was done. The
pressure of getting beef to market was all but ended for
that season. There were odds and ends of range work
for the riders yet, but the range had been combed once,
and so for a couple of days they would rest and play.</p>

<p>They were rid of the herd by two o’clock and back in
camp releasing their tired mounts and catching fresh
horses to ride into town. Tex Matthews caught a horse,
as did Robin. But when the riders swung up Tex sat
on the wagon tongue rolling a cigarette. Robin leaned
against a wheel, silently thinking. The <i>remuda</i> was still
in the rope corral. He had half a mind to rope out his
string, pack his bed, and go home.</p>

<p>“Come on, cowboys,” a Block S man called to them.
“The first drink’s on me.”</p>

<p>Matthews shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m keepin’ the cook and wrangler company,” he
drawled. “I’ll save money. There’s a long, hard winter
comin’.”</p>

<p>Robin said nothing.</p>

<p>The riders laughed and departed. The dust rose in a
low banner behind them, drifted like smoke on the autumn
wind and settled on ground made barren by the trample
of ten thousand hoofs.</p>

<p>Matthews finished his cigarette, strolled to the cook
tent, got himself a biscuit and a bit of cold beef. He returned
munching and joined Robin. They squatted on
their heels by the wagon. The sun, still lusty, warmed
them despite the chill October wind. They talked of inconsequent
matters. It was very quiet in camp. From
where they sat they could see the gable of the Silver
Dollar saloon. Neither man was a hermit by nature.
The cow-puncher had the social instinct. He was not
fond of loneliness, of inaction. All his work was done <i>en</i>
<i>masse</i>, with a swing, with the hearty coöperation of his
fellows. As they worked so they played. Tex and Robin
grew silent. They could picture the rest of the crew
swapping yarns and ribald jokes. There would be a poker
game or two, town men to meet, perhaps strange riders
with gossip from distant ranges&#8212;while they sat there in
a dead camp.</p>

<p>“Hell, let’s ride,” Matthews suggested at last. “I
thought I wouldn’t until to-night. But&#8212;let’s ride in.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Robin agreed.</p>

<p>He had given up the notion of leaving the round-up
just yet. There might be a stray Bar M Bar picked up.
He would see it through. And even if Matthews’ reason
had been as stated Robin Tyler had not stayed in camp
to avoid needless spending. He doubted if Tex had
done so. Between himself and this middle-aged Texan a
restrained, wordless friendship seemed to have grown
during the fall round-up. Robin suspected Tex had
stayed in camp because he himself had showed no inclination
to go. And Robin had not ridden in with the cowboys
because he knew little pleasure lay in store for him
while Steele was in the crowd. He would be wary, uneasy,
uncertain what moment Shining Mark would choose
to maneuver him into a situation from which he might
only emerge feet first.</p>

<p>“I guess the crowd’s in Monty’s from the looks,” Tex
remarked when they rode in among the houses. “Let’s
join ’em and hoist a couple, then go over to the Silver
Dollar an’ see if there’s a game goin’. Maybe we could
start one. I feel lucky. Will you play?”</p>

<p>“I might play ten dollars’ worth,” Robin said.</p>

<p>In search of diversion he would rather play poker
than drink. Poker left him clear headed even when the
game emptied his pockets. That seldom happened.
Robin played poker with much the same verve that characterized
his riding. His luck at cards had made many
a stock hand half-enviously utter the old saying, “Lucky
at poker; lucky in love. You ought to be a winner with
the girls, kid.”</p>

<p>Most of the Block S men were in Monty’s place. They
stood along the bar. Steele was among them and Tommy
Thatcher. Tommy in the hour or so that had elapsed
had contrived to build up a comfortable jag. He swayed
a little when he moved. He grinned amiably at nothing
in particular. His voice, when he spoke, was unnaturally
loud. The clatter of talk and laughter filled the place.
Over in one corner a drunken sheep-herder slept in a
chair, his head sunk on his breast, a bright-eyed collie
stretched on the floor by his feet.</p>

<p>A “rep” from the Shonkin was signaling the bartender
as they entered.</p>

<p>“Hey, you’re just in time,” he grinned. “Line up
here.”</p>

<p>He lifted his glass and chanted:</p>

<div style='margin-left:4em; margin-top:0.7em;'>
“Good corn whisky in a polished glass!<br />
Feed it to the cowboys when the range turns brown.<br />
Cows don’t want no liquor, all they need is grass.<br />
So here’s to good corn whisky! Drink her down!</div>
<div style='text-align:right; width:24em; margin-bottom:0.7em;'>Drink her down!”</div>

<p>Robin found a space between Tommy Thatcher and
another man. Mark Steele leaned an elbow on the bar
three removes. He craned his head to look at Robin with
a sardonic twist of his lips. Robin met his gaze squarely.
At least he would not quail before that sneer which held
so much of malice. And as their glances clashed Robin
felt Tommy Thatcher move. He felt his hand touch
something. He looked down. Thatcher had moved in
drunken uncertainty, or Robin had been careless. A
little of Thatcher’s whisky had spilled on the bar.</p>

<p>“What the hell! What you shovin’ for?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t shove you, Tommy,” Robin said gently.</p>

<p>“No back talk to me!” Thatcher roared. “Make room
for a <i>man</i>.”</p>

<p>He bristled up against Robin. It was not in that
young man’s mind to give ground for any one. If Steele
himself had thrust arrogantly in his face like that he
would have done just what he did to Thatcher&#8212;put out
his hand and shoved him back.</p>

<p>Thatcher stiffened as if some one had struck him. He
leaned a little forward, rose on the balls of his feet. His
whole body tensed. His face altered. It flashed into
Robin’s mind that Thatcher was suddenly sober&#8212;that
he had only been playing drunk. But he had only a
flicker of time for thought. Thatcher said hoarsely:</p>

<p>“You blasted, pink-cheeked pup!”</p>

<p>With the words he threw his glass of whisky in Robin’s
face.</p>

<p>A liquid containing roughly fifty-five per cent of alcohol
acts like mild vitriol on the tender membranes of the
eyeball. For a few seconds Robin felt as if a flame had
seared him. He was blind, blind and in pain. His
hands, groping, caught an end of the silk scarf draped
about his neck. With that he dabbed at his burning eyes.</p>

<p>They cleared. With tear ducts flooding, with the sting
and burn well-nigh unendurable, still after a fashion he
could see. Thatcher held his aggressive pose, his right
hand by his side with the elbow crooked so that his fingers
were even with the curved grip of the gun which he wore
on his belt&#8212;where most of the others carried their six-shooters
modestly tucked out of sight in the waistband of
their trousers. Near him Mark Steele leaned on the bar,
impassively watching.</p>

<p>Thatcher’s face cracked in a wide grin and something
happened in Robin Tyler’s breast. He didn’t quite know
what it was. He had never in his careless young life
struck a blow nor fired a shot in anger. He had never
even speculated upon himself as a fighting animal. But
for all his deceptive slimness he was a powerful man, lithe,
hard, active as a cat, with untapped and unreckonable
reservoirs of nervous energy.</p>

<p>What he did was to take a step toward Thatcher.
What he meant to do Robin himself scarcely knew, except
that he was going to do something. When the Texan’s
fingers closed on his pistol grip Robin leaped at him like
a sprinter off the mark so that all the weight of his body
as well as the spear-like thrust of his arm was behind the
fist that caught Thatcher on the point of his chin.</p>

<p>The Texan went down backward as if a horse had
kicked him. His head and shoulders hit the floor while
his spurred heels flipped upward. The back of his head
banged like a hammer on the foot rail that ran along the
base of the bar. He lay where he fell, blood oozing out of
his mouth and nostrils, his arms limp, scarcely a muscle
twitching. The dozen-odd men in the room stood still,
hushed, almost holding their breath. A man’s fist beating
a tentative gun play was rare in the cow country&#8212;and
the man was little more than a boy, a boy they all liked.
There was something about him as he stood there panting,
with clenched hands, that made them very quiet, made
their faces sober.</p>

<p>Then Mark Steele laughed, a queer mirthless sound.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said he. “If somebody took an ax and
chopped about forty pounds off John L. Sullivan maybe
we could match Tyler with him.”</p>

<p>The red mist flashed again before Robin’s smarting
eyeballs. But he didn’t try to hit Mark Steele. He
didn’t want to touch Steele with his hands. He wanted to
destroy him. Somehow he knew that Steele had taken a
new tack, that he had started Tommy Thatcher on him.
And there was only one answer to Steele, anyway.
Thatcher didn’t count. Robin made a dive for the Colt
sticking out of Thatcher’s scabbard. Live or die he
would put an end to this.</p>

<p>But he didn’t get it. Tex Matthews and half a dozen
other hands, divining his intention, grabbed him. They
could hold him, but they could not stop his mouth. He
ceased struggling to be free, twisted himself to face
Steele who stood erect now, ready for anything, cool,
alert, almost debonair, smiling slightly. Things were
coming Steele’s way now.</p>

<p>“You dirty dog!” Robin said to him. “You’ve been
tryin’ to work me up to something, and you’ve done it.
You and your twin on the floor! You want to choke me
off because I know too much. You two-faced cow thief!
You would-be killer that sicks another man onto
somebody else. Why don’t you come out in the open and do
your own dirty work?”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, kid,” Mark said mockingly. “You sure
got a powerful temper. You’re plumb reckless with
words.”</p>

<p>“Not as reckless as you are with other men’s stock.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Shining Mark shrugged his shoulders, “if
other men aren’t men enough to look after their stock&#8212;as
you call it&#8212;<i>I</i> don’t see where I’m to blame because
your girl asks <i>me</i> to ride home with her.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders again, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” Robin choked on his words. “By God,
Steele, I’ll kill you for that.”</p>

<p>“Lord, it’s a windy day.” Shining Mark settled his
hat on the back of his dark head. His tone was nonchalance
itself. “Now you’ve made your little war-talk, suppose
you get the boys to turn you loose so you can make
it good. <i>When</i> you’re ready. Go heel yourself if that’s
how you feel. You can always find <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Turn me loose,” Robin commanded. “I’m through
talkin’.”</p>

<p>They let him go and stood clear. All but Matthews.
Tex stood beside Robin. He kept his hand lightly on
Robin’s arm.</p>

<p>“Lend me your gun, Tex,” Robin had pinched all the
feeling out of his voice. He asked for the weapon as
casually as he might have asked for a match.</p>

<p>Matthews shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that, kid,” he said slowly. “You know I
can’t.”</p>

<p>“Here. Some of you fellows lend a hand with Tommy.”
Steele turned his back on Robin and bent over his fallen
friend. With the help of other Block S riders they lifted
up the unconscious man while the bar-tender passed over
a pitcher of water to revive him.</p>

<p>Robin looked at them a second. It was against the
range code for any man in that room to lend him a gun,
under such circumstances. He made for the door. There
were other men in town, who as yet did not know of this
clash. Perhaps&#8212;he strode away to the Silver Dollar,
and Matthews kept step beside him.</p>

<p>It was the same there. Robin left the saloon, went up
past the single row of houses toward the Sutherland
store. If he couldn’t borrow he could buy. And still beside
him walked Tex Matthews. Half way between saloon
and store Robin halted.</p>

<p>“What you stickin’ with me for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’m your friend,” Tex said. “If you ever needed one
you do now. After a while I got somethin’ to say to
you.”</p>

<p>“It’s all said,” Robin muttered and walked on. “I got
to get a gun.”</p>

<p>“Sure. But you won’t get one in this man’s town
to-day.”</p>

<p>News bears wings in a hamlet. It seems indeed if it
be ill news to have a telepathic quality of transmission.
Robin made his request matter-of-factly. Buying a Colt
revolver was probably as common a transaction as buying
a hat. But the clerk shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” he said, “but we can’t do it.”</p>

<p>Robin pointed to a row of weapons protruding from
a shelf.</p>

<p>“You got ’em for sale,” said he. “My money’s as good
as anybody’s. You take it for tobacco and clothes.
Why not for a .45 and some ammunition?”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” the man repeated. “I can’t. I got orders.”</p>

<p>Robin cast his eyes about the store. In the rear by the
bookkeeper’s high desk Adam Sutherland sat smoking a
cigar. Beyond him there was a figure Robin knew. He
turned on his heel and walked out.</p>

<p>“The deck’s stacked against me,” he said a little
bitterly to Matthews. “If I could get my hands on a
gun I’d settle it quick, win, lose, or draw. He’s forced
it on me even if it looks like I’m makin’ the play. I got
to go through with it, and why not now?”</p>

<p>“Come over here and sit down a spell,” Tex replied.
“I got somethin’ to say, myself.”</p>

<p>He led the way to a pile of ties beside the spur track
that served Sutherland’s store. They sat down. Before
them Big Sandy spread its limited area, two or three
dozen buildings on a bald flat, dwellings surrounded by
yards guiltless of tree or shrub, the unpainted walls
bleached to the drab gray of the sagebrush that flowed in
an unrippled wave to the edge of the town. The only
spot of color was the bit of green lawn about Adam
Sutherland’s white cottage. The cow horses dozed on
three legs in a row on the dusty street. Here and there
a man moved about his business. Beyond the town the
Bear Paws loomed against the sky line, a purple mass
with white tufts of cloud hovering about the high conical
peaks.</p>

<p>“Advice in a case like this is about as welcome as ice
cream in January,” Matthews broke silence. “Just the
same I got to pass some along. Maybe I won’t tell you
nothin’ you don’t know. First off, you got no license to
tangle with Mark Steele. You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I got no choice.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got this much choice,” Tex pointed out.
“You’ve declared yourself. But you ain’t put no time
limit on it. You made no break about givin’ him two
hours to quit town, or twenty-four hours to leave the
country or any such damn fool bluffs that you have to
live up to, or be laughed out of the country yourself.
You said you’d kill him. You can do that when you
get ready. You keep your hat on an’ let him think about
that.”</p>

<p>“Well?” Robin muttered.</p>

<p>Tex reached for his cigarette material.</p>

<p>“You ain’t ready yet,” he continued. “You won’t have
to go huntin’ trouble now. It’ll hunt you. You have an
enemy in Shinin’ Mark, but you’ll have a worse one in
Tommy Thatcher from now on. Steele’s bad, but he’s
game. He’d stack up against anybody, anywhere, anytime.
Thatcher’s different. You busted him horrible.
He’ll get you if there’s a chance, but it won’t be on the
square. You’ll need eyes in the back of your head for
Tommy Thatcher. I know him better’n you do. I know
of him a long time back.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as that makes any difference,” Robin
muttered.</p>

<p>“As for Steele,” Tex went on, unheeding the interruption,
“when it comes to gun play he’s got it on you
from soda to hock. He’ll rattle you first&#8212;you got a hell
of a temper, kid. I see that to-day for the first time.
You stew inside, and go off like dynamite. And I’ve seen
enough wild west to know you can’t stack up against a
cold-blooded proposition like Steele unless you’re as cool
as he is. Pass it up this time. Go home. Get yourself
a forty-five that fits your hand. Spend your wages on
ammunition. Practice faithful till spring. Then go get
him.”</p>

<p>“Meantime,” Tex patted Robin on the shoulder, “I
have a hunch what lays back of this trouble between
you and Shinin’ Mark. I seen enough this last week or so,
to know he meant to crowd you till you turned on him.
I think I know his game. I ain’t goin’ to take this fight
off your hands, Robin. But I can promise you one thing&#8212;if
he gets you I’ll get <i>him</i>. And that goes for
Thatcher, too.”</p>

<p>He lit his cigarette and stood up.</p>

<p>“I’m amblin’ along,” he announced. “You let things
go as they lay. Think over what I said and do it. You’ll
win.”</p>

<p>He stalked away. Robin sat on the ties staring at
the ground, his hands clasped over one knee. He appreciated
Tex Matthew’s moral backing, but it did not
assuage the bitterness in his heart. He had seen a man
or two run amuck and die with a smoking gun in hand
and he had wondered what drove a man to such desperate
measures, what terrible passion made a man court death
or inflict death. He knew now. It was no comfort to
him that he had punished Thatcher. Thatcher didn’t
count. He had played into Steele’s hand.</p>

<p>If he were dead he could not talk about stolen calves.
That was all Steele wanted, to stop his mouth or make
him leave the country. If he went up against Steele now
Mark would have his wish. Matthews had spoken the
truth and Robin knew it. With an even break for the
draw Mark would kill him before he could get his gun
leveled.</p>

<p>And still&#8212;when he recalled the look on Steele’s face,
the tone of his voice when he twisted Robin’s remark
about other men’s stock into an opportunity to put a
dirty slur on Ivy and so make Robin appear a fool writhing
in jealousy&#8212;he wanted a gun now. Chance or no
chance! When that feeling surged up in him he felt as
if he couldn’t stand living while Shining Mark was free
to talk like that. Yet, besides Matthews’ advice, a cold
little voice within Robin said that if he did arm himself
and go after Steele now he was as good as a dead man.
There was an uncomfortable chill in that assurance.</p>

<p>Robin sat deep in thought. He had forgotten where
he was. He had become almost oblivious of time and
place in brooding. The tempest of passion which had
made his heart swell until it seemed as if it would burst
had died out and left him depressed, almost sick, as the
poison of a great anger often does. He sat there locked
up in himself and he did not hear or see May Sutherland
until she spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” he answered her greeting. But he did not
rise nor doff his hat nor act as he would normally have
done. He couldn’t seem to think straight. He didn’t
understand why she was there at all, nor what she could
have to say to him. She belonged in the camp of the
enemy. That was natural. When a man attacked the
range boss of a big outfit the big outfit always stood
behind its own man. He had forgotten that May hated
Mark Steele. But May did have something to say to
him for she sat down on the ties.</p>

<p>“I heard about that trouble,” she began. “I heard
what Mark said to you and you to him. I’m awfully
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know why you should be,” Robin muttered.
“Not your funeral.”</p>

<p>“If there is to be a funeral I hope it will be his,” May
breathed. “But you are not going to be so foolish as
to fight him, are you?”</p>

<p>Robin smiled bleakly.</p>

<p>“You think a man should lie down and let another man
walk over him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I imagine Mark Steele could do and say things no one
could pass up,” she replied. “And what he said to you
about Ivy was rather terrible in its significance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you got that too, eh?” Robin observed. “They
talk in this town like a lot of old women. I expect there’s
been a lot of trimmin’s put on what happened. It got
to you quick.”</p>

<p>“It’s always like that in a little place. Everybody
knows all about everything at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes. They think they do.”</p>

<p>It ran in Robin’s mind that Steele had made his hand
very strong. Every one knew what had happened at the
dance on Little Eagle. The natural inference was that
Robin was crazy jealous since according to current conventions
he had every reason to be. Thus Robin’s threat
would be tabbed as the fury of a jilted lover. If he
jumped Steele and Steele killed him it would be a clear
case of self-defense. Robin squirmed inwardly to think
May Sutherland should regard him as merely a jealous
man with an uncontrollable temper. But he couldn’t complain,
he could not now of all times put forward his uncorroborated
word that Shining Mark simply wanted him
out of the way because Mark was rustling stock and
Robin Tyler had discovered certain incriminating facts.</p>

<p>“If everybody in Big Sandy has me sized up that way
you won’t get much credit for sittin’ here talkin’ to me,”
he said soberly.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to care what any one in Big Sandy thinks
of what I do&#8212;except my father,” she flashed at him.
Her next sentence startled Robin. “Why did you call him
a cow thief? It isn’t like you to call names.”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Robin’s tongue to say, “Because
he is,” but he checked that answer. His mind was getting
back to its normal acuteness. If May wondered
why he flung that at Mark, so might others wonder&#8212;even
Sutherland himself, being a cattle owner, might
privily ask himself if there <i>could</i> be any such fire behind
the smoke. As matters stood, what he knew about Steele
and Thatcher and the T Bar S might prove as effective
a weapon to fight Steele as any .45, if he could live long
enough to use it. He could blunt the edge of that weapon
by unsupported accusation now. They would say that
young Tyler was shooting off his face instead of his gun.</p>

<p>“I got nothin’ to say about that,” he told May. “In
fact I got no more to say about the whole business. I got
something to do about it, but I’m headed off just now because
I can neither beg, borrow, nor steal a gun in this
town, and I don’t own one. I will, though, before long.”</p>

<p>“You’re determined to go through with this?”</p>

<p>“Say, you’ve grown up in this country, even if you
went away to be educated,” Robin said impatiently.
“You know I can’t back up now. I couldn’t live in this
country if I went side-steppin’ Mark Steele after this.
You ought to know. Your dad has killed two men that
I know of in his time.”</p>

<p>May had a pair of gloves in her hands. She twisted
them, straightened them out, and crumpled them up
again. Robin sat silent. The girl rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“I wish you luck,” she said in a wistful tone. “It
seems to me utterly and terribly foolish for you to make
a threat in a passion and then in cold blood live up to it.
That’s carrying regard for your word too far.”</p>

<p>“I have a regard for my word,” Robin said stiffly. “I
never broke it yet. I don’t say things I don’t mean.”</p>

<p>“Even in anger?”</p>

<p>“I never was so mad I’d say what I didn’t mean,”
Robin protested. “That’s when a man <i>does</i> say what he
means. I do anyway.”</p>

<p>“Then you really accused Mark of being a thief? It
wasn’t just an angry taunt, an insult?” she challenged.</p>

<p>“You seem mighty curious about that,” Robin neither
denied nor admitted.</p>

<p>“I am. Because if you know that to be true you would
be a fool to risk your life in a clash with a man who is
deadly with a gun, cold-blooded enough to shoot you and
laugh about it. Let the law deal with him. There is law,
and officers with authority to deal with a cattle thief. I
wondered if there wasn’t more in this trouble than just&#8212;just&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Just a row over a girl,” Robin finished the sentence
grimly. “Well you’re right. There is. She was only
dragged in to make the play strong. I didn’t drag her
in. Anyway, I don’t want to discuss it any more. It’s
gone past the talkin’ stage.”</p>

<p>May looked down at him with a troubled air.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t thank me for interesting myself
in your affairs,” she said. “But I’d much rather see
Mark Steele dead or in jail, than you.”</p>

<p>“So would I. A darned sight rather,” Robin’s old
humor flashed once through the cloud of gloom. “I’d be
tickled to death to have him on the inside looking out.
Maybe you will.”</p>

<p>“Dad is in the store. He told me to tell you he wanted
to speak to you,” May said abruptly. “Good-by&#8212;and
good luck.”</p>

<p>“Same to you,” Robin returned. “Only you don’t need
no luck wish. You got all there is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps my luck doesn’t take in as much territory
as you think,” May said over her shoulder as she walked
away.</p>

<p>Robin watched her pass through the picket fence that
enclosed the white cottage and its square of green and
he wondered idly what she meant. Then he remembered
Sutherland wanted to speak to him. About what?
When Adam Sutherland expressed a desire to speak to
a cow-puncher it was in the nature of a royal command.
Robin was no subject of this cattle king’s, but he had
sufficient respect for Sutherland to heed the request&#8212;as
a matter of courtesy, if nothing more.</p>

<p>Sutherland still occupied his big armchair.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Sit down.” Sutherland indicated another
chair. “I want to give you some advice.”</p>

<p>“Seems like I’m gettin’ a heap of advice, one way and
another, this afternoon,” Robin observed dryly.</p>

<p>“Mine won’t do you no harm,” Sutherland rumbled.
“You’re young and by all accounts you sure got a
temper. I don’t criticize you for that. I was that way
myself once. But it ain’t healthy, no more. Now about
this trouble between you and Mark Steele&#8212;forget it.
There’s no sense in you two shootin’ each other up. You
said a lot of nasty things down in Monty’s place.
You made a bad break when you promised to kill
Mark. You won’t want to, once you’ve slept on that. Nobody’s
goin’ to question your nerve. I knew your father
by reputation, and your folks in the South. Blood counts
in men same as it does in stock. You don’t have to feel
you got to shoot it out. Mark’ll drop it if you will.”</p>

<p>“Has he said so?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Sutherland admitted. “But I know he will.”</p>

<p>“I make no promises,” Robin said slowly. “It wouldn’t
be no use. I don’t think you know your range boss as
well as you think you do. He couldn’t pass me up if he
wanted to.”</p>

<p>“You mean you wouldn’t let him?” Sutherland interpreted.</p>

<p>“You can ask him what I mean. Maybe he’ll tell you.
Maybe he won’t.”</p>

<p>“Why in hell don’t you say what you mean, out loud?”
Sutherland demanded.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I said what I mean right out loud and
plain to the party concerned this afternoon,” Robin answered.
“I’m not swallowin’ anything just so your range
boss won’t have to be mixed up in a fuss.”</p>

<p>“He’ll kill you sure, if you stack up against him,”
Sutherland grumbled. “I don’t like the way you talk,
Tyler. I’d hate to see a kid like you get his light put
out by one of my men. But, darn it, you can’t call a
man like Mark Steele a cow thief just because you’re
sore at him over a girl. That ain’t reasonable, now is
it? Mark hasn’t put on his war-paint. You’re the one
that’s lookin’ for trouble.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” Robin conceded, “but things ain’t
always what they look.”</p>

<p>“What was in the back of your mind to call Mark a
cow thief, anyway?” Sutherland asked bluntly.</p>

<p>“You can ask him that, too,” Robin said. “Here he
comes.”</p>

<p>Steele walked the length of the store as jauntily as if
he had no care in the world, as if each stride were bringing
him near a man with whom he would have been glad
to shake hands instead of to kill.</p>

<p>“You ain’t got no gun, have you?” Sutherland half-rose
from his chair.</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“If I had it would be smokin’ now,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Steele came up to Sutherland and Robin. He was
smiling. That is, his face and lips smiled, but his eyes
were like gray agates, hard and cold and watchful.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid,” he said evenly. “Hope you got over
bein’ hostile. You don’t really aim to kill me, now do
you?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve changed my mind,” Robin answered quietly.
“I’m goin’ to put you in the penitentiary instead.”</p>

<p>With that he walked unconcernedly past Steele and
out of the store.</p>

<p>Robin walked to where his horse stood, mounted and
rode to camp. In half an hour he was jogging out the
south trail behind his thirteen loose horses. Dark overtook
him twenty miles from town. He penned his string
in the corral of an abandoned horse ranch, spread his
bed in an old cabin and slept, supperless. At dawn he
tightened his belt a hole and rode again. At ten-thirty
his horses ran nickering down the bank into the Mayne
yard. A ranch hand working on a woodpile sauntered
over to the corral. Robin saw Ivy come to the kitchen
door and draw back.</p>

<p>“The old man around?” he inquired as the ranch hand
helped him strip the gear off the pack horse.</p>

<p>“Uh-uh. Makin’ a ride somewheres,” the man said.</p>

<p>Robin shook off his spurs and chaps and went to the
house. Ivy sat by the kitchen table, nursing her face
in her hands. She looked up as Robin entered, in a way
that gave him a pang. She seemed sad, even a little
afraid of him, and although Robin had seen her in a
temper, had seen her sulky, he had never known her to
grieve, to look subdued and unhappy.</p>

<p>He went up and put his arms about her.</p>

<p>“Hello, hon,” he greeted. “How are you? What for
you look like the blue devils had got you? Aren’t you
glad to see me back?”</p>

<p>For answer Ivy put her dark head against him and
wept. She tried to speak and the words seemed to choke
her.</p>

<p>“I was scared,” she got out at last. “It’s all my fault.
I was a darned fool, Robin. I’ve made all the trouble.
My heart’s been in my mouth all day. I felt bad enough
before&#8212;since that dance. But to-day.”</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>“What’s worryin’ you now?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>He did not see how news of his clash with Mark Steele
could possibly have reached the Bar M Bar so soon.
Therefore something else had cropped up to trouble Ivy.
But he was wrong.</p>

<p>“One of the Davis boys was in town yesterday,” Ivy
told him. “He got home in the night. Dad was up there
seein’ the kids. Sam told him about you and Mark and
Thatcher lockin’ horns. Oh, Robin, I was lookin’ to hear
you’d been killed. I was scared&#8212;scared and sorry.”</p>

<p>“You got nothin’ to be sorry for about that,” Robin
soothed her.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I act like a fool at that dance and stir things
up?” Ivy mourned. “I asked Mark to take me to Davis’s
just to spite you. Ugh!”</p>

<p>She peered up into Robin’s face.</p>

<p>“Did you&#8212;did Mark?” She seemed unable to go
farther.</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have a gun. I couldn’t get one in Big Sandy.
Maybe he’d ’a’ got me if I’d been heeled. ’Tain’t finished.”</p>

<p>Ivy’s sobs broke out afresh. She clung to Robin and
would not be comforted. She felt that this clash had
come about solely because of her. And Robin couldn’t
enlighten her. Outside of himself and her father no one
knew what happened that day below Cold Spring, no one
knew the motive that was the mainspring of Shining
Mark’s actions, nor Robin’s. Telling wouldn’t help.
It might easily prove fatal. Let them all, including
Ivy, think the trouble arose over her, until time and
chance and effort proved Mark Steele a common thief&#8212;if
he, Robin, lived that long. And he meant to live.</p>

<p>“I hate him,” Ivy wailed. “I’m afraid of him. And
still&#8212;oh, Robin, it’s awful. When I’m with him I feel&#8212;as
if&#8212;as if&#8212;he could do what he liked with me. I
wish he was dead! He’ll kill you. I know it. He’s a
wolf&#8212;a wolf!”</p>

<p>“Wolves get trapped now an’ then,” Robin muttered.
“Don’t you worry about Mark Steele no more, hon. I
don’t <i>sabe</i> why he should make you feel that way if you
really like me. Do you really, truly?”</p>

<p>Ivy put her arms around his neck and held up her
tear-wet face.</p>

<p>“You know I do,” she cried passionately. “You know
I do. You’re worth all the Mark Steeles that ever wore
boots. It’s me that’s no good. Why should I go crazy
because another girl looked at you the way May Sutherland
did, if I didn’t care? But Robin&#8212;say&#8212;have you
never met with another girl since you’ve loved me that
made you feel&#8212;oh, I don’t know. As if you’d like to
run your fingers in her hair and have her kiss you. You
don’t really want to, but, but, you think about it. Oh,
Robin, Robin, what’s the matter with me?”</p>

<p>Robin couldn’t answer that except by shaking his head.
He was troubled. It hurt him to think of Ivy nursing the
least tenderness for another man. And still&#8212;Robin remembered
himself sitting on a hill with May Sutherland,
looking off into a sunset. He did not know whether the
thing that troubled him was the beauty of evenfall drawing
in across a painted sky, or the girl’s presence, her
physical nearness, the deep sweet tones of her voice.
Even now, standing with his arms about Ivy, stirred to
unsuspected depths of tenderness by her sorrow, he could
not shut out May Sutherland’s image. It was there,
vivid, alluring. Still May was nothing to him, nor he to
her. He was promised to Ivy and he did not desire it
to be otherwise.</p>

<p>He shook himself free of these abstractions. Ivy loved
him. That was good enough. If Shining Mark could
momentarily fascinate her as a snake is said to charm
a bird, that was something against which he must protect
her. Mayne’s cattle and Mayne’s daughter&#8212;who was
another man’s promised wife. Shining Mark was decidedly
a thief. Robin despised him but he did not make
the mistake of under-estimating Mark’s ability and courage
in pursuing his desired ends. But for the time&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>“Say, hon, I’m famished,” he said presently. “No
supper. No breakfast. Forget your troubles and rustle
me somethin’ to eat. Everything’s goin’ to be all right.”</p>

<p>Ivy smiled, kissed him, and flew about the kitchen to
prepare him food. She sat beside him while he ate. She
perched on his knee while he smoked a cigarette and her
sorrows vanished. She could laugh again. She promised
Robin, assured him repeatedly, that she would never be
jealous again. She was glad to think that Shining Mark
would not again come riding to the ranch. Robin could
assure her of that without telling her more than she
already knew. He felt that Mark would not risk bearding
both himself and Dan Mayne on their own ground.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon Mayne came home. He
sat down to talk it over with Robin.</p>

<p>“By gosh, kid,” said he, “I’m scared you’ll have to
fly the coop. You ain’t no match for that jasper. You
wouldn’t have a ghost of a show. An’ Thatcher’ll be
layin’ for you too.”</p>

<p>Robin looked off through the haze of Indian summer
lying on the creek bottom. The tips of the Little Rockies
loomed like a mirage on the eastward horizon above a
great spread of undulating sagebrush and the gashed
desolation of the Bad Lands. The nearer hills were dun
with autumn shades, arid, brown. For a moment
he visualized the return of spring, a green and dazzling
world with flowers opening&#8212;and himself not there.</p>

<p>“I won’t run,” he said quietly. “I’ll play the hand
I’ve got since I’m in the game.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you do?” Mayne asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll be organized all the time,” Robin said briefly. “I
ain’t worryin’.”</p>

<p>The old man stuffed his pipe and puffed furiously for
a second or two.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we can get a cinch on him,” he said
hopefully. “I’ll take a shoot up to Helena and see if I
can’t get the Association to put a stock detective down
here for a spell. An’ we’ll have to ride, Robin. I covered
some country already. I’ve picked up some stuff here
an’ there. I guess I’ve gathered as many as forty calves.
They’ve sure cut back lots of unbranded stuff. I bet
they’ve stole five thousand dollars’ worth of calves from
me in the last year. There’s Block S’s too. I bet you
they throw what they steal across the river when she’s
froze.”</p>

<p>Robin grasped his meaning. The Missouri runs like
a broad band across Northern Montana&#8212;a wide, deep,
swift river well named the Big Muddy. It was an effective
barrier to wandering stock, since range cattle
seldom swim unless forced. Only in rare and terrible
winter storms when the northwest blizzards raged over a
long period did northern cattle move south of that barrier.
Seldom did range stock from the Musselshell and
the Judith Basin cross the big ice. No one on the south
side would think twice about T Bar S stock here and
there&#8212;unless fresh iron work showed. During the fall
and winter when the ice held, Steele and Thatcher could
work on unbranded calves and throw them south. More
and more Robin wondered why Shining Mark and
Thatcher had chosen to kill those cows and brand their
calves that day within riding distance of the Bar M Bar.
A calculating cow thief, Robin concluded, would take a
foolish chance when temptation offered. And Steele was
really master of the broad range covered by the Block S.
He had felt safe. Every calf branded was so much to
the good. The mere chance of laming a horse by Cold
Spring had tipped his hand&#8212;mere chance alone. If
Robin had not crippled Stormy, he would not have suspected
Mark Steele of rustling. And now that Mark
Steele knew his game was known he was out to offset that
whim of chance by making the country too hot for Robin
Tyler. Kill him or make him run. It was simple.</p>

<p>Mail for the south hill region came by stage once a
week to the ranch near Little Eagle. Robin posted an
order for a .45 Colt to a store in Fort Benton. He rode
up to mail that letter with a Winchester carbine under
his stirrup leather, a short, handy weapon in a carved
leather scabbard. Robin was fairly sure of his mark
with a rifle. He had a good eye and a steady hand.
Thereafter the carbine was never far from his reach.</p>

<p>He and old Mayne rode far in the next few days, looking
through the twisted and torn confusion of gulch and
canyon for calves slipped out of various drives by Shining
Mark and his Texan confederate. The days slid by
without event. Ivy seemed happy once more, as if she
had forgotten. She would laugh and tease, plague Robin
as she had always done for the fun of having him catch
her close in his arms and playfully threaten her with
dire consequences. Sometimes Robin had to stop and
assure himself that he hadn’t suffered from a waking
nightmare, that Shining Mark’s sinister activity and all
its aftermath were not some sort of evil dream. Once or
twice he pulled up on the height of land where he parted
that evening from May Sutherland to sit and ponder.
He could visualize her so clearly. Then he would shake
himself and ride on. There seemed to be a vague disloyalty
involved in even thinking of May. Yet he wondered
where she was, what she did, what she thought.
Strangely he never indulged in such speculation about
Ivy. He didn’t have to&#8212;he knew Ivy, all her moods and
tenses; or he thought he did. Once he said to himself
whimsically:</p>

<p>“Wonder if everybody sometimes gets wishin’ for the
moon?”</p>

<p>That was as far as he went along that road.</p>

<p>From the drift of gossip that ebbed and flowed through
the Bear Paws, Robin learned, somewhat to his private
satisfaction, that he had done Tommy Thatcher an uncommon
amount of damage with one stout blow.
Tommy had suffered a broken jaw. Incidentally the iron
foot-rail had fractured his skull. They had shipped him
to a Fort Benton hospital and he would not be about for
at least a month. When he did come Robin surmised that
he might come shooting. Still, that was no certainty.
Tommy might let it ride. Tommy had started it, and he
might conclude that it wasn’t worth following up&#8212;or at
least inaugurate his private war under the rose, so to
speak. In any case what Thatcher might do was less
concern to Robin than what Mark Steele would certainly
try to do as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>He began practice with the new six-shooter when it
came. Riding here and there he would flip it from its
scabbard and let fly at a bit of sage, a prairie-dog, a tin
can by a water hole, anything that loomed as a mark.
He accustomed himself to the wicked crack of the explosion,
the jump of the weapon in his hand. He would
draw and draw, as a pugilist in training shadow boxes,
for speed and certainty, until certain movements became
almost automatic, until he did not have to look or grope
or fumble. It became a game of skill, like the golf swing,
or the timing of a return in tennis. He found himself
acquiring a control beyond what he expected when he
began.</p>

<p>In a month, during which he burned up forty dollars’
worth of ammunition, Robin found himself taking a
genuine pleasure in mastery of the weapon. Simply to
snap the gun at something on the ground, to see the can
or whatever it was, jump in a blob of dust, gave him a
peculiar satisfaction, very like the concealed pride a
roper gets from putting his loop over a cow’s horns at
the limit of his throw. If Shining Mark had never
crossed his trail, he reflected, he would never have thought
of getting fun out of pistol-practice with a Colt .45. It
was fun, a form of play he had never indulged in before.
He wondered sometimes if his father, who had been reputed
handy with a gun, had liked to play thus. And if
his play had led in the end to using a gun in deadly
earnest, to his mother’s sorrow? Robin’s mother had
hated guns. She blamed Colonel Colt, not the passions
of men, for her untimely widowhood. Robin felt a little
glad she was not alive to grieve over her son who was following
in his father’s footsteps&#8212;perhaps to the same end.
A woman, he reflected, couldn’t <i>sabe</i>. Ivy didn’t understand.
Neither did May Sutherland. He doubted if
even May knew that while a man might love life dearly,
under certain conditions it wasn’t worth living&#8212;not
if a man had to crawl before another to hold life in
security.</p>

<p>So he kept his daily practice to himself, and the real
purpose of his practice.</p>

<p>Meantime, old Dan Mayne made a trip to Helena.
When he came back he seemed a little surprised.</p>

<p>“They tell me there’s been a stock detective layin’ low
on this range for six months past,” he said. “Just on
general principles, they say. He ain’t reported nothin’
yet, so they don’t take me serious seein’ I couldn’t name
no names. I didn’t dare do that. Jim Bond’s the registered
owner of the T Bar S all right. He claims it.
Looks like the only way I can keep Mark from stealin’
me blind is to beat him to everythin’ that belongs to me.”</p>

<p>So they continued to ride. The school term ended.
The two Mayne children came home from the Davis
ranch. Robin kept pretty well out of the Bear Paws.
He did not go to dances. It irked him a little to know
what construction people would place on that. But he
had no intention of putting his head in the lion’s mouth
until he felt he had a chance to blunt the lion’s teeth.
And Ivy didn’t seem to miss dancing&#8212;at least, not much.</p>

<p>November brought frost, hard, steel-bright nights,
days when the ground rang under shod hoofs like an
anvil. There were flurries of snow but no great storm,
only a tightening of the cold grip of winter.</p>

<p>When the first snow whitened the range Robin and old
Mayne were in a river bottom forty miles from the Bar
M Bar with a pack outfit. Here they picked up a few
head of Mayne stock. They drove them out of that
bottom into another. In this second flat they rounded
up a hundred head of wild cattle, getting a stand on the
bunch against a steep earth wall. There was a sprinkling
of unbranded Block S calves, fat sleek beasts still being
suckled by their mothers. This was not the first time
they had spotted unbranded Sutherland calves in out-of-the-way
places.</p>

<p>“He ain’t playin’ no favorites, is he?” Mayne grunted.
“Before spring every one uh these’ll be packin’ a T Bar
S. I wonder if Adam Sutherland is asleep?”</p>

<p>The little herd stood quiet. Robin pointed silently,
twice. Each time his finger marked something they had
not yet encountered&#8212;a T Bar S cow with a big unbranded
calf. This was a bunch the round-up had missed
altogether. Old Mayne spotted the calves Robin indicated.
He sat sidewise in his saddle, staring, scowling.
Then he jerked the Winchester out from under his
stirrup-leather and fired twice. The first T Bar S cow
dropped like a stone. The second ran fifty yards and
collapsed. Mayne thrust the rifle back into place, grinning
wolfishly. The bunch scattered in a panic. He
began to undo his rope.</p>

<p>“You get your twine on that other calf,” said he.</p>

<p>Robin rode up beside him.</p>

<p>“Do you know what you’re doin’, darn you?” he demanded
hotly.</p>

<p>“’Course I know. I’m gittin’ back some of my own, by
thunder,” the old man swore. “You git that calf.”</p>

<p>“No,” Robin said. “I’m no thief. If you’re goin’ to
get down to Mark Steele’s level, I quit you right here and
now.”</p>

<p>“Hell’s fire!” Mayne lifted both hands and cried aloud.
“Ain’t he stole hundreds from me? Ain’t I a right to
get even?”</p>

<p>“Not this way,” Robin persisted stubbornly. “I’ll
back you in any legitimate play as far as you want to
go. But not in this. You’ve killed those cows and that
can’t be helped now. But if you mark those calves, I
tell you I’m through with anything that has to do with
the Bar M Bar.”</p>

<p>“You’re through anyhow,” Mayne raved in fury.
“Mark’s got you buffaloed. He’ll nail your hide to his
barn door. You’re just plumb scared, that’s all. I’ve
done this before to T Bar S’s, and by the Lord, I’ll go
on doin’ it!”</p>

<p>“You’ll do it by yourself, then,” said Robin. He swung
his horse about. The pack animal grazed a hundred
yards distant. Robin rode straight to him. Mayne sat
still a second, then followed.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do?” he demanded harshly.</p>

<p>“Take my blankets and some grub and hit the trail,”
Robin said. “When it comes to makin’ a common thief
outa myself, I quit before I begin.”</p>

<p>“Aw, hell, kid!” Mayne changed his tone. He began
to expostulate.</p>

<p>In the end they rode out of that bottom together taking
only Bar M Bar stock. The unbranded T Bar S
calves remained with the wild bunch. Mayne grudgingly
promised that he would kill no more cows. He was full
of vindictive resentment against everything and everybody.
But he didn’t want to lose Robin.</p>

<p>“You’re so damned straight you lean over backward,
kid,” he said grudgingly. “<i>I</i> don’t feel like I was a
thief. Maybe you’re right, but I sure don’t reckon it no
sin to play even thataway when I think of what Mark
Steele’s doin’ to me.”</p>

<p>That was Mayne’s last long ride. He had grown old
in the saddle. He could not face the weariness and discomfort
of riding and lying out in bitter weather as
lightly as Robin could.</p>

<p>“I guess we got most of mine, anyway,” Mayne said.
“You can circulate around, if you like. I can’t stand
this no more.”</p>

<p>Robin meant to circulate, as Mayne graphically put it.
There were plenty of Block S calves in places he knew.
Robin meant to ride and watch. In the back of his mind
was a pretty definite idea of what he would do if he
ever caught Steele and Thatcher at work. His purpose
was hardening. He didn’t really expect such luck. They
would probably see him first. But there was always the
chance.</p>

<p>At no time did Robin see anything of the Block S
riders, except one or two casual meetings. Sutherland
had a winter line camp, fifty miles or more east, deep in
the Bad Lands, another twenty miles southward of Cold
Spring in the mouth of Birch Creek. While a range boss
did in winter occasionally drift about the various camps
belonging to his outfit, Robin neither met, saw nor heard
of Shining Mark. It seemed indeed as if Christmas might
come and go and spring flowers bloom again before the
normal round would bring him face to face with his
enemy&#8212;if the enemy did not take up his trail.</p>

<p>Then one day, Robin, who occasionally spent an afternoon
or night at his own homestead, met Tex Matthews
leading a pack horse with bed lashed on, just by his own
claim. They stabled their horses, carried the Texan’s
bed inside, lit a fire in the stove, and sat down to warm
their feet.</p>

<p>“Well, kid, how’s tricks&#8212;the tricks of the trade?”
Tex smiled.</p>

<p>“So, so,” Robin said. “Nothin’ to write home about.”</p>

<p>“Thatcher’s back,” Tex informed him. “I hear him
and Steele is down at the Cow Creek camp. Better keep
your eye pealed.”</p>

<p>“Has he made any cracks?”</p>

<p>“Heard none. But he’ll have it in for you. That’s
a cinch. By the way,” Matthews abruptly changed the
subject. “I wonder if old Dan wants another rider?”</p>

<p>“He might,” Robin answered. “You ain’t quit the
Block S?”</p>

<p>“The Block S quit me,” Matthews grinned. “Mark
let me out a week ago.”</p>

<p>“What’d the old man say?” Robin pricked up his ears.
Tex had ridden for Sutherland long before Shining Mark
joined the outfit.</p>

<p>“He’s away. Don’t reckon he’d say anything. He
never interferes with a range boss.”</p>

<p>Robin stared at him.</p>

<p>“I wonder&#8212;&#8212;” he began, and stopped short. He
wanted to ask “Why?” Matthews understood. He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Mark has ways of his own&#8212;and reasons,” he remarked
indifferently. “It just don’t suit him to have me
around, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you saw too much.”</p>

<p>Tex laughed outright.</p>

<p>“You’re gettin’ to be a regular Sherlock Holmes, kid.
I dunno. Maybe he thinks I did. Anyhow, I’m kinda
sorta lookin’ for a job.”</p>

<p>“What you want to work for a one-ring circus like the
Bar M Bar for?” Robin asked. “You could ride for any
of the big outfits.”</p>

<p>“Just a notion. Maybe I want to steal your girl?”
he grinned cheerfully at Robin. “I tell you, kid,” he went
on whimsically, “I’d like to ride around with you on this
range a spell looking over cut-banks and cow tracks just
to see what goes on&#8212;just for fun. Besides&#8212;oh, well, I
got to work, and I’ve a notion to work for Mayne.”</p>

<p>“Come on down and ask him,” Robin counseled. “I’d
sure like to have you with me. He’s got to put on a rider
in the spring anyhow. I couldn’t ride with the Block S
if I wanted to.”</p>

<p>Old Mayne looked at Tex and told him he could consider
himself on the payroll forthwith. Later, he asked
Robin in an aside:</p>

<p>“Reckon we better put Tex wise to Shinin’ Mark or
leave him find out for himself?”</p>

<p>“I’ll wise him up,” Robin volunteered. “I have a hunch
he don’t need much tellin’.”</p>

<p>Nor did he. When Robin discreetly broached the subject
and related what lay behind Mark Steele’s venom,
Tex merely grinned.</p>

<p>“I figured it somethin’ like that,” he observed. “It’s
a tough proposition. Mark’s smooth and aggressive.
He’s got a big swing. Sutherland has confidence in him,
trusts him to the limit. That’s the way old Adam is.
If he’s with you he’s with you all the way. Still&#8212;Mark
has made a fatal mistake.”</p>

<p>“What?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>“Hidin’ behind another man’s ownership of a brand,”
Tex knitted his brows. “If he’d said to Sutherland:
‘I’m goin’ to have a few cows of my own an’ make a start,’
Sutherland would have done one of two things. Either
told him straight he couldn’t own cattle an’ run the Block
S at the same time, or he would have said it was a good
scheme an’ for him to go right to it, save his money an’
get somewhere. But Mark has played it too foxy. If
he’s rustlin’ under the T Bar S brand he owns it, or the
biggest share in it. If Sutherland ever finds out his range
boss has a silent ownership in a brand on his own range,
right there Mark’ll come to the end of his rope. Old
Adam’d get him an’ get him right. Barrin’ that, Mark’s
got all the best of it just now. He’s put you in wrong.
He’ll get you if he can. You know too much. He can
always bluff Dan Mayne. If he wasn’t afraid, old Dan
would have bellowed it all out loud long ago. There’s
nothin’ but your word against Mark yet. But as a
matter of fact, kid, I&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>Tex broke off. He grinned.</p>

<p>“I won’t talk, right now,” said he. “From now on
I’m a Bar M Bar rider. Two heads are better’n one. I
can’t tell you <i>all</i> I may know or think, Robin, old boy.
But I’ll say this: If you go up against Shinin’ Mark too
soon an’ do kill him, you’ll have to go on the dodge,
because Sutherland’ll sure try to put you in the pen. So
you keep clear of a fight with Mark Steele if you can.
Maybe by spring you won’t have to throw lead with him.
Maybe a deputy with a warrant’ll save you the trouble.”</p>

<p>They slept on that.</p>

</h2>

<p>In between the high moments of any man’s existence
life seems to flow evenly, with a monotonous smoothness,
like the placid reaches of a slow stream between foaming
rapids. For a time it was like that with Robin. He
rose before dawn, performed small tasks, rode abroad
more or less perfunctorily during the day. Storms blew
up and blew over. Between blizzards the range lay
quiescent. Cattle and horses fed on high ground where
the sun warmed them. When night came or harsh winds
stung too bitterly they sought shelter in canyons, in the
sparse timber of the foothills, in the rough tangle of the
Bad Lands. Winter for the range herds was a period
of endurance, a struggle to survive. In this dumb
struggle man had little part. Cattleman and cowboy
alike kept to warmed quarters. Their saddle horses
munched hay in log stables. The range stock attended
by their enemies, the blizzard and the prowling wolf,
drifted at will until spring should bring green grass.</p>

<p>Probably Tex Matthews and Robin were abroad more
than the ordinary business of the range required. They
rode partly because old Mayne chafed under an uneasy
sense of property rights wantonly violated&#8212;partly
because they desired of their own accord to overlook nothing.
In that wide sweep of plain and rolling hill and
endless canyons, wherever that four-legged loot was
abroad, there was always the chance of the unexpected,
a chance to catch Mark Steele red-handed, to get evidence
that would convict him before the law which reflected
the dominant material interest of the time and
territory, inasmuch as it functioned with greater speed
and precision in the matter of stolen stock than it ever
did in a mere question of human life.</p>

<p>Sometimes Robin, in the kitchen helping Ivy dry the
supper dishes or sitting beside her by the rough fireplace
in the front room, would wonder if this ugly tangle was
quietly unraveling itself&#8212;or if this were just a lull.</p>

<p>Since the day they clashed in Big Sandy he had not
laid eyes on Shining Mark. Except for remaining away
from dances in the Bear Paws where Mark was likely to
be, he had not deliberately avoided the man. Indeed,
from Chase Hill to the mouth of Cow Creek, from Cold
Spring to the Missouri he had ridden alert and watchful,
eager to come on the man about his nefarious undertakings.
He doubted now that he would. Mark would
be well aware that he must step more softly than ever
since Tex Matthews rode for Mayne. Yet Mark might
be abroad with his running iron in spite of everything.</p>

<p>About three weeks after Tex joined Robin one of the
Davis boys rode into Mayne’s and stopped for a meal.</p>

<p>“There’s a dance at the schoolhouse Saturday night,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“Saturday night?” Robin regarded him intently.
“All right. We’ll be there with bells on.”</p>

<p>They were all looking at him curiously, young Davis,
Tex, Ivy, her father, even the two juveniles. Robin felt
that he was under fire.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there,” he repeated. “You tell ’em so.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go,” Ivy broke out, after the Davis boy had
ridden away. “You know what’ll happen. Mark Steele’ll
be there. Please, Robin! Let’s not go.”</p>

<p>“I’ve said I’d go,” Robin murmured. “An’ I’m sure
goin’. I’m not goin’ to winter in my hole like a darned
badger. I won’t start no fuss. If <i>he</i> does&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” Tex put in. “Tommy Thatcher’s
rangin’ around. Better to show ’em you ain’t afraid.”</p>

<p>So in the end they prevailed over Ivy’s fears. And
neither Mark Steele nor Tommy Thatcher attended the
dance. Whether from discretion or because they had
business elsewhere Robin never learned. They danced all
night with hearts as light as their heels and rode home in
a frosty sunrise. When Robin and Tex drew off their
boots in the bunk house to sleep an hour or so Tex said:</p>

<p>“I heard Steele an’ Thatcher been down in the Cow
Creek line camp over a week. We might take a <i>pasear</i>
around that way.”</p>

<p>“If they’re down there, we better,” Robin agreed
sleepily. “We’ll take a pack outfit and jog down that
way to-morrow, maybe.”</p>

<p>The morrow found them riding. It might be a fruitless
quest but no range man ever caught a cow thief by sitting
with his feet to the fire. So they bore away southeast
from the Bar M Bar. Noon found them deep in the
Bad Lands. Dusk would bring them as near the Block S
line camp as they planned to go.</p>

<p>For twenty miles or more north of the Big Muddy and
eastward nearly to the Dakota line the Bad Lands
spread, grim and desolate. Gouged and ripped and distorted
in some past glacial period, the confusion heightened
by centuries of erosion, it bared itself to the sky in
a maze of canyons great and small, fantastic with layers
of vari-colored earth, red, brown, gray, ochre, like
painted bands on the precipitous earthen walls. Scrub
pine timber grew in clumps, thickets, lodge-pole pine
made small forests, wherever roots could find hold and
sustenance. Many of these deep gashes were flat-bottomed,
threaded by streams of bitter alkali-tainted
water. On the narrow, winding benches that carried the
plains level down to overlook the river bunch grass waved
like fields of wheat. In midsummer it was hot, arid, the
haunt and breeding ground of rattlesnakes and wolves.
In winter, with snow to serve in place of water, the Bad
Lands gave grazing and shelter to tens of thousands of
cattle.</p>

<p>To the stranger fresh from a kindlier land it was a
lonely, abhorrent place, wrapped in a sinister silence,
a maze in which the unwary traveler could lose himself
and leave his bones for the coyotes. Even to the range
men who worked it every round-up, riding the Bad Lands
was far from plain sailing. A rider could get twisted, he
could travel for hours and then find himself in a cul-de-sac.
He could find himself within shouting distance of
another horseman and be compelled to make a detour of
fifteen miles if he wished to shake hands.</p>

<p>Yet it was not all desolation. There are oases in the
desert, atolls in the widest sea, harbors on the ruggedest
coast. So in the Bad Lands the wayfarer came unexpectedly
on little valleys, small basins, tiny grassed areas
surrounding some cold spring, spots like friendly gardens.
Men had dodged the law upon occasion down there, ever
since law and order came laggardly behind the cowman
and settler. The cow thief, the outlaw, the slayer who
held himself justified in his homicide and would not brook
arrest had from time to time made the Bad Lands a
sanctuary. Riders faring through that wilderness upon
legitimate business came now and then upon an abandoned
cabin huddled in a gulch, perhaps masked by pine
thickets. If it were abandoned to the rats and the
weather they looked and rode on. If it showed signs of
occupancy they rode on without looking.</p>

<p>Robin and Tex headed for one such place which they
had found while on circle two seasons earlier, and thought
they could locate again. The curse of the Bad Lands is
the ghastly similarity; one gulch, one canyon, one winding
plateau is fellow to all the rest. There are no peaks,
no hills; it is all etched deep in a general level, like a
sunken garden planned by a madman. A man needed a
keen sense of direction, a most acute sense of location to
find his way to any given spot.</p>

<p>The two came at last to a point where uncertainty
rested on them. Robin knew he was within a couple of
miles of that particular cabin. But in the network of
broken land he could not be certain. Nor could Tex. It
was all gray, brown, dusky pine-green, far as the eye
could reach. The chinook wind had stripped the range of
snow. The frost held. The ground was like flint. The
December wind sighed mournfully about their ears.</p>

<p>“The hell of this country is that you never can be sure
where you are,” Robin complained. “I thought that old
camp was in the mouth of this gulch. Let’s try the next
bench.”</p>

<p>“Can we follow this one to the river?” Tex wondered
when half an hour brought no result.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’d as soon not make camp in the river
bottoms,” Robin said.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it would be good policy,” Matthews
agreed. “But say, I’m gettin’ empty. Let’s camp the
first water we strike.”</p>

<p>Robin nodded. They bore down a ridge that seemed
to offer access to low ground, out of that biting wind.
The point of this spur ran suddenly out into a circular
depression, unsuspected, unseen until they came upon it.
It was like a meadow surrounded by a deep fringe of jack
pine and lodge-pole. They reined up in the belt of timber
and stood to gaze.</p>

<p>A round corral stood in the middle of this flat. A
long wing ran from one side of the bars&#8212;a typical pen
for wild stock.</p>

<p>“Never saw <i>this</i> before?” Robin lowered his voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t know as you better see too much of it right
now,” Tex murmured. “Least not till we see if anybody’s
around. This here looks like strictly private premises to
me. There’ll be a cabin an’ water handy. Maybe likewise
some eagle-eyed jasper with a Winchester.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look her over anyhow,” Robin suggested.</p>

<p>“Do the lookin’ afoot, then,” Tex counseled. “I wish
there was snow. Tracks would tell.”</p>

<p>They were well hidden by the timber in which they had
pulled up. They tied their horses in a thick portion of
the grove. Carbines in hand they began to encircle this
small basin, moving always under cover. On the farther
side where a low place pitched out of the flat toward a
gloomy canyon they found a pole cabin by a small clear
spring. They stared silently from a thicket of chokecherry.
To their right loomed the roof of another
shelter. There was no sign of life.</p>

<p>“Let’s go clean around and take a look for tracks,”
Tex whispered. “Then we can ride up an’ investigate
this here secluded dwellin’.”</p>

<p>They did so, returned to their horses, satisfied that
the flat harbored no life. They mounted, rode across the
open, pulled up beside the corral.</p>

<p>“She’s been used recent.” Robin pointed to fresh
cattle-signs. His roving eye lit on fresh charred wood.
“Been some iron work.”</p>

<p>Tex nodded. Both were grown silent, wary. That
hidden place, the fire-sign, the trampled floor of the corral
told a definite story. No range rider needed pictures to
illustrate that tale.</p>

<p>They rode on to the cabins. By the spring where the
earth was moist they found fresh horse tracks, shod
horses, leading both in and out. Tex squinted at the
ground.</p>

<p>“That was yesterday,” he stated with conviction.
“Let’s see how the shack is fixed for use.”</p>

<p>Looking first into the brush-hidden building they discovered
it to be larger than it looked. It was a stable
with room for two horses and all the rest of the space in
one end packed with hay, bunch grass cut with a sickle.
The marks of the haying were plain on the nearby sward.
They grinned at each other and walked over to the house.</p>

<p>A pile of fresh-cut wood beside a clay and stone fireplace.
A single bunk in each of two corners, filled with
pine needles pressed to the shape of a man’s body. The
earthen floor marked by the pointed heels of riding boots.
Otherwise it contained nothing of significance. A rude,
bare shelter with cold ashes on the hearth. They went
outside.</p>

<p>“I wonder what she spells?” Tex murmured.</p>

<p>“We might find out. Maybe some <i>hombre’s</i> startin’ a
cow camp, an’ craves privacy,” Robin smiled. “Maybe
this is where Mark an’ Thatcher are gettin’ in some good
licks on the Block S. I’d sure like to know.”</p>

<p>But it was not on the cards that Robin should learn
what he wanted to know in the immediate future. They
talked a minute or two longer. It was mid-afternoon.
They had ridden far. It was a cold day and night would
be colder. Finding the cabin they sought in that network
of canyons was a slim chance now, would be merely a
gracious smile of fortune. Only those who haunted the
Bad Lands could say where each spring and meadow and
deserted cabin stood. Even they might not always find
such spots as they sought.</p>

<p>“We might have passed within a hundred yards of this
more’n once an’ never seen it,” Tex remarked. “I’d say
this building was done last year. Funny none of our
riders come on it. The Pool worked this country last
spring, too.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t ten men in Montana,” Robin said, “that
know every hole in the Bad Lands. Likely enough,” he
snorted, “Shinin’ Mark would lead a circle right past
here, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“It’s a right good spot,” Tex drawled. “Central location.
You bet. Halfway between Boiler Bottom an’ Cow
Island. Yeah&#8212;for stuff that was missed in the breaks on
round-up&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“There was some missed, I rise to remark,” said Robin.
“Between me an’ Mayne I guess we’ve spotted two hundred
Block S calves unbranded. Most of ’em range
within fifteen miles of this corral. This place was made
to order for them that’s draggin’ the long rope.”</p>

<p>“Well, do we stay here, or do we make camp in the
next likely place we strike?” Tex inquired.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t sleep good if I stayed here,” Robin smiled.
“Let’s go down this draw. I don’t want to hang around
this place. I’m goin’ to spot it so I can find it again,
though. We sure want to cast our gaze on this from
time to time to see what goes on.”</p>

<p>“You’re shoutin’,” Tex grinned.</p>

<p>They rode down the draw from the spring, each striving
to fix in his mind the contours of the surrounding
landscape. They took bearings on the ragged peaks of
the Bear Paws in the northwest, on the Little Rockies
that broke the sky line eastward. And they watched
closely the lay of the land as they rode so that later they
could back track.</p>

<p>The draw closed to a narrow gulch. That fell away
steeply into a canyon bottom, fairly wide, level-floored,
gray with sage stirrup-high. A good many cattle grazed
on those flats. This narrow valley came in from the
south. They judged that it offered a continuous route
to the Missouri, if it was not actually a fork of Cow
Creek. They stopped a minute to consider this, to mark
the gulch they had come down. Below them the canyon
took a sharp turn to the east. Opposite this point a
gorge came down from the high benches. Its mouth was
cluttered by pine and cottonwoods. There would be
shelter there and firewood, probably water. They shook
up their horses and discussed the making of a night camp.</p>

<p>As they came abreast of the cottonwoods and while yet
some three hundred yards distant Matthews, riding knee
to knee with Robin, straightened stiffly in his saddle, put
one hand to his breast. Robin happened to be looking
directly at him&#8212;Tex had been speaking. Robin saw the
action, the strange look of surprise and pain. At the
same moment something plucked sharply at the leather
band of Robin’s chaps&#8212;and he heard two quick, clear
cracks somewhat muffled in the distance.</p>

<p>Thought, vision, the registering of an auditory impression&#8212;all
three were instantaneous. So was action.
Being fired upon they did not stand to gape. Their
horses spun on shod heels. A hundred yards away the
dry bed of the creek was cut ten feet below the surface
of the valley floor. Into this they plunged, bullets
whining by.</p>

<p>Once in the wash Robin threw his horse back on his
haunches, jerked the carbine from under his leg, flung
out of his saddle. With the bank for a breastwork he
meant to fight, not run.</p>

<p>A sidelong glance as he turned showed him Tex drooping
over his saddle horn. Robin stepped back. His
heart sank. He knew the signs.</p>

<p>“Ride, kid,” Tex whispered. “Ride like hell. They’ve
got me&#8212;got me good!”</p>

<p>Robin caught him as he slid down, as the horse shied
at the falling body. In an agony of sorrow and rage
Robin looked once, bent to see the glaze gathering over
the Texan’s blue eyes. Then he leaped to the edge of the
bank. Lying flat with his rifle cocked and thrust out before
him he waited for the assassins to follow up their
advantage.</p>

</h2>

<p>Ten days from the evening Tex Matthews died in the
frozen bed of a lonely creek Robin rode again in the Bad
Lands, this time alone. No one knew whither he went,
nor why. He scarcely knew himself. If he could have
embodied his feelings in words he would have said that
he could not rest quietly under circumstances that drew
about him like the crushing coil of a python, a dread
thing which he could neither combat nor fly from. Sometimes
a curious fear stirred in his heart, and again&#8212;when
he thought of Tex&#8212;a resentful ache. His world
was all askew. There was no faith nor honor nor even
justice. Thieves flourished and murder went unchallenged.</p>

<p>“Shot to death by some person or persons unknown.”</p>

<p>That perfunctory verdict echoed in Robin’s ears like
a damnable irony as he pulled up his horse once more in
the pines which bounded the corral and cabins he and Tex
had discovered. Robin knew those “persons unknown.”
But a moral certainty does not establish guilt before
the law.</p>

<p>He shivered a little, recalling that day and hour. He
had lain on the edge of the washout with a dead man
below him and he had prayed that the killers would show
themselves. But nothing save a few cattle startled by the
shots moved in that lonely place. He had lain until his
fingers numbed and his body grew stiff with the cold, until
the dark shut down. Then he had lashed the Texan’s
corpse across his blood-stained saddle and groped his
way out of the Bad Lands, rode the long night through
leading a tired horse with a ghastly burden that had been
a man.</p>

<p>Here he was again, urged against all reasoned judgment
into the enemy’s territory. Robin was no fool to
discount the chances he took. He had no plan. He
trusted to luck. He would ride warily as a scalping Indian
as long as the food in his saddlebags lasted. If
only he could get something definite to go on&#8212;or better
still if he could drop those two red-handed in their predatory
activities. Given a crew of riders and two weeks
Robin knew that a round-up of T Bar S cattle would
show that their number had trebled in a twelvemonth.
Nothing less than positive proof would shake Adam
Sutherland’s fatuous belief in the integrity of his range
boss.</p>

<p>Probably, in the end, Robin thought, he would have to
kill Mark Steele&#8212;if Mark didn’t beat him to that outcome.
Perhaps deep in Robin’s breast lurked the savage
desire to stake all on an encounter and so end uncertainty.
A man cannot always fathom his own motives.
Still, in spite of the indignities Shining Mark had heaped
upon him, a festering sore in his mind, and Matthews’
slaying added to the ugly total, Robin was not there
for bushwhacking, but to learn if indeed Thatcher and
Steele did use that lonely corral and for what purpose.</p>

<p>He viewed it now from the concealment of the timber.
He had approached the place cautiously riding in a
wide circle around it on high ground. A three-inch layer
of new snow blanketed the earth. No track led in or out
from the place. Robin turned away and bore off toward
the river.</p>

<p>He made camp in a gulch at dusk. During the next
day he jogged in and out of various bottoms, flats in
which both with Mayne and Tex he had noted scores of
Block S cows with their unbranded calves. The cows were
there still. The calves were gone. Robin rode far and
looked closely. The clean-up had been made. But where
were the calves? Robin stared across the frozen reach
of the Missouri and guessed the answer. He marked
herd after herd of grazing cattle with never a sign of
fresh iron work, nor a single unbranded calf. He would
rest his hands on his saddle horn and ponder. Where
would <i>he</i> dispose of a hundred-odd fresh branded yearlings
if he were a cow thief.</p>

<p>Psychology to Robin was no more than a term occasionally
encountered in his last year of a frontier
grammar school, a word lightly taken and soon forgotten.
But he knew his people and his time. And he had imagination,
that penetrating vision which is at once a curse
and a blessing to its possessor. He could put himself in
another man’s shoes.</p>

<p>So he looked south of the river. In the end he crossed,
leading a trembling horse that slipped and slid and once
or twice fell on the glaring ice.</p>

<p>From far below Boiler Bottom he rode westward on
the Judith Basin side, in a region where no man lived.
He passed the mouth of Armells, Arrow Creek, other
small, nameless streams. He rode in still, wide-floored
canyons where cattle grazed, over benches, back to the
river flats again, looking, looking. He ate the last of his
food. He slept like a wild animal in the lee of a bank or
a brush patch, he dozed over little sagewood fires. And
he came out at last near the mouth of the Judith River
opposite where Birch Creek flowed in from the Bear Paws.</p>

<p>He was hungry and weary. The frost had touched his
cheeks, for the thermometer at night dropped to twenty
below. The range lay hard and wan under a bright
moon, and glittered in the midday sun. But Robin was
content to endure. He had found much that he desired to
find. If he could only establish Mark Steele’s interest
in the T Bar S brand he knew he could make good his
word and put Mark Steele in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Thus Robin as he looked to the homeward side of the
big river. In all the jumbled area behind him no man
rode in the dead of winter. The Judith Basin cow outfits
had their home ranches far south in a creek and
meadow country. The cattle that ranged where he had
been would see no riders before the spring round-up. The
PN on the Judith a few miles above was the only habitation
within a hard day’s ride of where he stood&#8212;south of
the river. Robin was tempted to ride to the PN to eat
warm food, to sleep in a bed once more.</p>

<p>But there was also the urge for home. Directly across
from him a little way up Birch the Block S had a line
camp. Two riders held it down, as much to keep the
men occupied as for aught they could do for the Sutherland
interest in winter. Robin knew both riders stationed
there. He could lie over an hour, get something to eat,
reach home by dark. He had not eaten in twenty hours.
His mouth watered at the mere thought of hot coffee.</p>

<p>The chance of Shining Mark turning up there was remote.
Robin knew why Mark and Thatcher kept to the
lower end of the Block S range. In any case, as he rode
up Birch Creek, he must pass this camp. And he would
never again step aside an inch for Mark Steele or any
other man. Something of the hardness of the winter
frosts seemed to be creeping into Robin’s soul.</p>

<p>An hour later he rode through sagebrush that reached
to his knees and came to a cabin and a stable in one
corner of a small pasture fenced with poles. Smoke wavered
from a pipe. Two saddled horses stood before the
door. A head thrust out as Robin drew rein.</p>

<p>“Hello, cowboy,” Ed Doyle greeted. “You lost, or
just goin’ some place?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” Robin returned. “Been some place, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Well, get down an’ rest your saddle,” Doyle invited.</p>

<p>Robin got stiffly down. Doyle’s red-headed companion
took a shrewd look at Robin and his mount.</p>

<p>“Better put that <i>caballo</i> in the stable so he can eat
as well as you,” he said. “You look like you’d been
’round the Horn.”</p>

<p>“Mark Steele ain’t floatin’ around by any chance, is
he?”</p>

<p>A brief glance telegraphed between the two Block S
men. Robin could interpret that. They thought he was
out for Steele.</p>

<p>“Naw,” Bud Cartwright said. “He ain’t been here but
once this fall. You’d be more likely to locate him down
around Cow Creek from what I hear.”</p>

<p>“I sure don’t hanker to locate him right now,” Robin
smiled. “I’d rather locate a cup of hot coffee than anything
I know.”</p>

<p>“Got your order,” Bud grinned. “She’s still steamin’
on the stove. There’s biscuits and a hunk of fried beef.
Fly at it, Robin. We’re fed. Got to take a swing over
toward Chip Creek. Make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>Robin stabled his mount. When he came back to the
house the other two were in the saddle.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back somewhere between now an’ dark,”
Doyle said. “Keep the fire goin’, kid.”</p>

<p>“I will if I stay,” Robin agreed. “I ain’t sure I will.
Kinda like to get home. See how I feel after I’ve got
some grub under my belt.”</p>

<p>“Well, the house is yours,” Bud drawled. “So long.”</p>

<p>Robin stirred up the fire, ate like a famished wolf. He
was weary to the innermost core. For five days he had
only taken off his boots to warm his feet for an hour or
so by the fire. His bones ached from sleeping on frozen
ground. With a full stomach he drew up to the stove,
rested his stockinged feet on the hearth, sat there smoking,
debating whether he should stay or ride on.</p>

<p>The warmth of the room wrapped him like a comfortable
garment. His eyelids drooped. His chin sank on
his breast.</p>

<p>He came out of that doze with a start, with a sensation
of having been disturbed, with a strange intuition
of a presence in the room besides himself. He became
aware of his pistol scabbard empty on his hip. For a
breath he tried to recall if he had laid the gun aside.
Then, his head turning slowly to verify that warning intuition
of personal nearness to something, he saw Mark
Steele and Thatcher standing between him and the door.</p>

<p>Steele had Robin’s Colt in his hand. He was smiling,
with a faint curl of his upper lip. Thatcher grinned with
a satisfaction that sent a ripple along Robin’s back.</p>

<p>He didn’t speak. He looked at them silently. His
tongue was not numbed, nor his brain. But there was
nothing to say. They had him cornered, disarmed.
What would they do? He canvassed the possibilities in
a detached, impersonal fashion.</p>

<p>Steele broke the silence at last. He backed up a step,
seated himself on the edge of the table, dangled one foot
so that the silver spur tinkled. His eyes never left Robin.
They were cold and gray, unlighted by any feeling&#8212;except
it might be a touch of calculation. He laid Robin’s
six-shooter beside him.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Tyler of the Bar M Bar,” said he, “the last
time we talked you said you were goin’ to put me in the
pen. How about it? You got out a warrant for my
arrest yet?”</p>

<p>Robin did not answer.</p>

<p>“Too scared to talk?” Steele taunted.</p>

<p>Robin’s answer was a shrug of his shoulders. A
shadow flitted across Steele’s dark face.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you talk,” he gritted. “Here, Tommy, you
take the horses to the stable,” he ordered. “Unsaddle
’em. Shut the door when you go out, so the cold air
won’t bother Mr. Tyler. His feet are chilly now.”</p>

<p>Thatcher glanced from Robin to Steele, back to Robin
again. His brows crinkled a little. He seemed uncertain.
But he went out without a word.</p>

<p>“Now, darn your hide,” Mark’s tone was acid. “I
hate to mess up a nice clean cabin, but you’ve bothered
me long enough.”</p>

<p>His fingers closed on the grip of his belt gun.</p>

<p>“You’ve bothered me long enough you &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;!”
he snarled. “You hear me?”</p>

<p>Through Robin’s mind flashed the thought that deadly
as Steele was he could not quite cold-bloodedly shoot
down a man who sat in a chair and stared dumbly at him.
Hence the vile epithets. Mark had to stir him up&#8212;or
work himself up. Robin faced slowly about on the chair.</p>

<p>“I hear you,” he said quietly. “Go ahead, shoot.
You’ll be proud of yourself after you’ve put out my light.
You’re a powerful brave man, Steele.”</p>

<p>Robin said that casually, for all his heart was beating
double-quick. Whether he rose to Steele’s taunting or
not the man would kill him. Intention, determination,
were explicit on Shining Mark’s face, in his stony stare,
the slow withdrawal of his gun from its scabbard. Robin
was a menace Steele must remove for his own safety.
That cold feeling went over Robin again in a wave.</p>

<p>But all the time his stockinged toes were pressing
harder and harder into the dirt floor, the muscles of his
legs were tensing. At least he would not die like a tame
sheep, bleating for mercy where there was no mercy.</p>

<p>And when the gun leaped clear with a sudden jerk, as
if Steele had made up his mind to get the job done, Robin
leaped also.</p>

<p>Shining Mark had made the mistake of staying too
close, of miscalculating the distance an active man could
hurl himself with the speed of a winking eyelid, when
moved by a desperate resolve. Robin did not strike. He
clutched with both hands for that gun, thrust it aside.
Mark Steele was a strong and active man himself. For
a few seconds they struggled. Robin clamped both hands
over the gun, turning it back on Mark, jammed him
against the wall. He was the heavier, the stronger of the
two, but he could not tear loose the weapon from Steele’s
grip. To loose one hand and strike was dangerous. To
let go and stoop for his own weapon now fallen to the
floor meant that Steele would kill him as he stooped. Any
moment Thatcher might enter. Then of a surety he was
a dead man. And it was more fitting Robin felt, with a
fury that burned him, that Steele or Thatcher, or both,
should die if death was to stalk in that camp.</p>

<p>Slowly he turned the muzzle back toward Steele. One
of his fingers slipped inside the trigger guard. His
thumb hooked around the curved hammer. He jabbed
Steele suddenly with one knee, and in the momentary relaxation
of the man’s grip Robin managed to pull the
trigger.</p>

<p>The report of the .45 was like a cannon blast in the
room. Shining Mark let go, left the gun in Robin’s hand.
His fingers fumbled at the base of his throat. Then he
sagged and weaved and his knees doubled under him. He
became a sprawling figure face to the floor, with strange
spasmodic twitching of his outstretched fingers.</p>

<p>Robin retrieved his own gun. His rifle stood by the
wall. He picked the Winchester up. There was still
another snake to scotch. Like a wolf at bay or a tiger in
the circle of beaters pure savagery was driving Robin
now. Every primitive instinct buried deep in man was
on top. He opened the door. For the moment, rifle in
hand, with that dark rage upon him, Robin would have
faced all the fiends of hell itself&#8212;and Thatcher was only
a man.</p>

<p>The Texan was walking rapidly toward the house. In
Robin’s seething brain the thought arose: “They knew
I was here. They followed me. He thinks Mark has
downed me.”</p>

<p>He stepped, scarcely conscious of his stocking feet, out
into the snow. As the foresight of his rifle lined on the
Texan’s breast, Thatcher stopped dead in his tracks,
flung both arms high in the air. Robin held his fire.
Ripe to kill as he was he couldn’t shoot. He walked
toward the Texan, the anger dying out of him like a receding
tide. But for all that he cursed the man, slapped
him brutally, raged at him with tears in his voice, disarmed
him and drove him into the house. Thatcher grew
pale at sight of his confederate stretched on the floor.</p>

<p>Then Robin stood still to collect his thoughts. He beheld
himself yet between the devil and the deep sea. He
had killed the Block S wagon boss as he had publicly
declared he would. Adam Sutherland would remember
that.</p>

<p>“Turn your face to the wall,” he commanded Thatcher.</p>

<p>“Kid, for God’s sake!”</p>

<p>“You dirty dog!” Robin gritted. “<i>I</i> don’t murder men
from ambush, nor shoot ’em in the back. You do what I
say.”</p>

<p>Thatcher obeyed. Robin took a piece of clothesline
and tied his wrists tightly, backed him up to a bunk
nailed to the wall and lashed him securely to a corner
of that. Then he put on his boots, his overcoat, took
both their guns and shut the cabin door on the prisoner
and the dead.</p>

<p>He saddled his own horse, turned out the other two,
hastened their going with a flicking rope-end. In half an
hour he would be on the high benches. Until Bud Cartwright
and Ed Doyle returned he was safe from pursuit&#8212;probably
longer. He knew Doyle and Cartwright.
They would not hasten to sound an alarm over any one
killing Shining Mark.</p>

<p>He mounted and loped away up Birch Creek straight
for the Bar M Bar.</p>

<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER XIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE</span>
</h2>

<p>Dark had fallen. The winter night was setting its
teeth hard when Robin dismounted in the Mayne yard.
He had forgotten about being tired. His brain had kept
a strange sort of time to the drum of hoofs on the frozen
ground. He couldn’t make a decision. His instinct was
to stand his ground. Yet he knew the risk of that.
Sutherland would be implacable. Once a fighting man
himself, for a long time Sutherland had frowned on gun
fighting on his range. He had grown old and rich. Both
publicly and privately he was strong for law and order,
set against feuds. He was a fanatic in loyalty. He
would never believe that Mark Steele had forced the issue.
He would say he meant to see justice done when in reality
he would be seeking revenge on an alien rider who had
killed one of his trusted men.</p>

<p>Robin held his decision until he could talk with Dan
Mayne. Red Mike stood in a stall. He could ride fast
and far. He stood a moment to pat the red horse’s
glossy hide, thinking that he hated to run. He had been
afraid and he was no longer afraid. He would never be
afraid of any man again. Robin had never heard a
champion pugilist’s dictum that “the bigger they are the
harder they fall”, but that was in essence how he felt now.
Only, as a reward for proving that truth to himself, he
did not wish to wear a striped government suit and enjoy
free lodging in state quarters for an indefinite period.
Adam Sutherland was powerful enough in Choteau
county to inflict that penalty on him.</p>

<p>He walked into the house. Mayne sat by the fireplace
sucking his pipe. Ivy came to meet him.</p>

<p>“I’m empty as a last year’s water barrel,” he said to
her. “Get me some supper, will you, hon?”</p>

<p>“Where on earth have you been all this time in this
kind of weather?” Ivy stayed to ask.</p>

<p>“Oh, every place,” Robin put her off. “Go on, old
girl. I’m starved.”</p>

<p>Ivy went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Steele jumped me this afternoon down at the Birch
Creek line camp. I killed him,” Robin said bluntly, as
soon as they were alone.</p>

<p>Mayne took his pipe out of his mouth. For a second
he looked incredulous. Then a shade of fear crossed
his face.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he breathed. “The fat’ll be in the fire
now. The Block S’ll be on us like a bunch of wolves.”</p>

<p>“On us?” Robin queried. “How? Where do you come
in? I did the killin’.”</p>

<p>“How?” Mayne echoed. He rose to his feet, strode
up and down the room. “How? Hell, I know Sutherland.
He’ll make this range too hot to hold me. He’ll
take this personal. He thought the sun rose an’ set
around that &#8212;&#8212; &#8212;&#8212; &#8212;&#8212;!”</p>

<p>He spat a mouthful of epithets on the dead man.
Robin stared at Mayne with a little heart sinking. This
was the reward for loyalty. Mayne saw only his material
interests further imperiled by the inevitable dénouement.
The big fish, angered, would harry the little fish who had
troubled the range waters. It came over Robin with a
discouraging conviction that for all he was in a way of
becoming Mayne’s son and right bower he could expect
little backing, either moral or financial, in this crisis.
Mayne had been furious at Shining Mark’s depredations,
furious and afraid. Shining Mark would rustle no more
Bar M Bar calves. But Mayne had a new fear&#8212;Sutherland’s
anger. The Block S could blackball him, refuse to
handle his stock, bar his riders from round-up, throttle
him in a dozen ways.</p>

<p>Something like contempt stirred briefly in Robin.</p>

<p>“I don’t see where you need worry,” he said.</p>

<p>Perhaps his tone brought Mayne back to a consideration
of immediate consequences.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to jump out, I guess,” said he. “Sutherland’ll
get you buried for life if you stand trial, no
matter how good a defence you got. How’d the play
come up?”</p>

<p>Robin told him briefly. The old man listened, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“You ain’t got a chance in the world, unless you could
prove Mark was actually stealin’,” he gave his opinion.
“Thatcher’ll swear black is white an’ white’s no color at
all. Gosh, Robin, I wish you hadn’t got Steele.”</p>

<p>“If I’d ’a’ known you’d back water in a pinch maybe
I wouldn’t,” Robin said slowly. “He didn’t steal my
calves. I could ’a’ let it slide. I could ’a’ told Shinin’
Mark I was deaf, dumb, an’ blind about what went on on
this range, and he would have left me alone. You’re a
poor stick, Mayne.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t either. I’m as game as the next,” Mayne retorted.
“But I can go broke on lawyers an’ witnesses a
whole lot quicker than Adam Sutherland, an’ get put
outa business besides. It’s all right for you wild kids to
rip an’ tear regardless. It’s took me thirty years to
collect a thousand head of cattle an’ a home.”</p>

<p>He strode up and down the bare floor mumbling to himself.
Robin sat thinking. He would have to go on the
dodge. If he stood pat he would be under arrest within
forty-eight hours. Mayne was frightened. He could see
that. The old man wanted only to wash his hands of the
whole business.</p>

<p>Ivy came to the door and beckoned. Robin sitting with
downcast eyes did not notice. She came in, looked from
one to the other.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong now?” she demanded. “Somethin’ is.”</p>

<p>“This crazy kid has gone an’ killed Mark Steele,”
Mayne flared up. “We’re tryin’ to figure what he’d
better do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my own figurin’,” Robin said tartly. He had
already made up his mind. “I’m goin’ to eat an’ ride.
You can rest easy. I won’t mix you up in no big trial.”</p>

<p>Ivy stood as if petrified. When Robin put out his
hand to her she shrank.</p>

<p>“So&#8212;oh,” he breathed. “It jars you like that, does
it?” and walked past her into the kitchen.</p>

<p>His food was on the table. He set himself to eat. It
might be a long stretch between meals, he thought grimly.
But beyond a bit of bread and meat and a cup of coffee
food seemed to choke him. He was calm enough. He
had no more regret than he would have had at crushing
a snake’s ugly head under his boot heel. But he quivered
inside. He sat alone by the table listening to the mutter
of voices in the other room. He had played the game.
Because he had played a desperate trump to take the
winning trick, he must lose. He felt that. Mayne most
of all feared for his security as a little cowman tolerated
in the heart of a cattle king’s domain. Ivy&#8212;he couldn’t
make her out. Something seemed to be slowly freezing
inside Robin.</p>

<p>Ivy came out of the other room at last and stood looking
at him as he rolled a cigarette and lit it, nursing his
chin in one palm as he blew smoke.</p>

<p>“It’s awful, Robin,” she sighed. “I wish I’d never gone
to that dance. What’ll you do?”</p>

<p>“Hit the trail,” he answered.</p>

<p>Ivy stood still. She didn’t offer to kiss him. She
seemed deep in some consideration which had, Robin felt
forlornly, very little to do with him.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me?” Some obscure impulse
prompted the question. “I might never come back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t do that,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Then she flung herself at Robin, clung to him. She
buried her face in his shoulder, shaking with sobs.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s awful, Robin,” she cried. “I can’t bear it.
It’s awful!”</p>

<p>“Can’t bear what?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>He had no key to her mood. He couldn’t tell whether
her grief was for him or Mark or for herself, or whether
this tragedy in which she was involved simply oppressed
her beyond endurance. But her grief racked him. He
knew no way to comfort her. He could not stay to comfort
her. For a moment he thought of explaining that
this trouble had arisen simply because Mark Steele was
a thief trying to cover his trail. But it was a little late
for explanation which did not alter facts. They had
never told Ivy the real truth. And Mark was dead. It
didn’t matter now.</p>

<p>She withdrew from his arms and began nervously to
gather up dishes. Robin watched her for a minute.
Some sort of impalpable barrier was between them.
Nothing he could say or do would make it any different.</p>

<p>“Well, I got to get organized,” he said and rose. Ivy
looked at him once, went on with her work. Old Mayne
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“What you aim to do?” he inquired uneasily. “Stand
pat, or light out?”</p>

<p>“What you think yourself?” Robin asked. It was an
idle question. He knew what he would do. He was only
curious to know what Mayne really wanted him to do.</p>

<p>“If it was anybody but Sutherland you might come
clear,” Mayne grumbled. “With the Block S pullin’
the strings you’ll get manslaughter sure as blazes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I stand trial and get a year, or two, or ten?”
Robin went on. “Where’ll I be at with you two when I
come out?”</p>

<p>Mayne glanced at his daughter, wet his lips with the
tip of his tongue. The girl stood silent. Robin looked
from one to the other. A faint sardonic smile fluttered
about his lips.</p>

<p>“You got a home here anytime you come back,” Mayne
said. “You know that.”</p>

<p>There was no warmth in the assurance. Robin felt that
when he had ridden out into the night something like relief
would be the most definite sensation in the agitated
breasts of these two.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t need to worry,” he said at last. “I’m
not goin’ to stand arrest. I don’t know as any Tyler
ever did, come to think of it. Chances are if they send
a deputy sheriff after me he’ll ride careful, prayin’ to
God he don’t come on me. There’s a lot of territory between
here an’ Texas where a man can make a fresh
start.”</p>

<p>He walked out without waiting for an answer. Mayne
followed with a lantern. Robin saddled Red Mike, led
him out and dropped the reins at the bunk house door.
There were a few odds and ends he wanted, clothes he
would need. In twenty minutes he was ready, rifle slung
under his stirrup leather, a hundred rounds of ammunition
belted on, his clothes in a war bag across his saddle.
He turned with his hand on the stirrup and walked back
to the house. He couldn’t leave Ivy like that. He was
sick inside, but he couldn’t go without a word.</p>

<p>“I’m gone to the wild bunch, hon,” he put his arms
around her.</p>

<p>Ivy sobbed afresh, repeating that senseless “Oh, it’s
awful,” over and over until Robin stopped her mouth
with a kiss that brought no answering pressure from her
cold lips.</p>

<p>“I’m gone,” he said briefly. “You want me to come
back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to go,” she cried, “I don’t want
you to go!”</p>

<p>“I got to.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. All right,” she seemed to collect herself.
“Write to me Robin, an’ tell me how you make out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get word to you,” he promised. “Good-by.”</p>

<p>Within ten minutes he drew up at his own door. He
came near passing the dimly outlined cabin with a glance
and a sigh, but he recalled some papers he thought wise
to take and so dismounted. He struck a match, got
what he wanted out of a tin box on a shelf, and rode on.</p>

<p>The moon was still below the horizon. Robin pointed
Red Mike’s nose straight for the Block S home ranch
and rode fast. The point he bore for lay straight across
the Bear Paws where the Montana Central branched off
the main line of the Great Northern. He could go in
three directions from there. He would be on a train before
word of that killing reached the Block S.</p>

<p>He had an idea that pursuit and search would be perfunctory
until Adam Sutherland stirred up the county
authorities, privately speeded up the mechanism of the
sheriff’s office. Even if Thatcher or one of the others
took horse and rode they could cover ground no faster
than he. He would beat them to the railroad by hours.
After that&#8212;well Robin knew the range men, banked for
safety on that knowledge. They would look for him anywhere
but on a train. And Robin meant in that hour to
turn his back forever on the range and cattle and cow
thieves&#8212;all that had been his life ever since he could
remember. He rode over the high, moon-washed divide of
the Bear Paws in snow three feet deep, with a maturing
plan and a definite purpose and destination in mind. A
clean break! A new country, a different country. Everything
behind him severed.</p>

<p>From the Bar M Bar to Havre Junction was a little
over forty miles in an air line. Robin dismounted in the
outskirts of the little town at three P.M., having ridden
the distance in six hours.</p>

<p>He stood patting Red Mike’s sweaty neck while the
beast nuzzled him impatiently.</p>

<p>“So long, old boy,” he whispered. “You’ll be free to
roam now. I hope nobody grabs you just because they
know I’ve quit the country.”</p>

<p>Red Mike rolled in the snow, shook himself like a dog,
ambled away, vanished in the dark. In three or four
days he would be grazing with the wild horses on Chase
Hill, or by Cold Spring, back in his old haunts. Robin
watched him go with a little pang.</p>

<p>Then he took his saddle on his shoulder and passed
along a dark street until he found a livery stable with a
sleepy hostler whom he roused off a cot in the office.</p>

<p>“I want to leave this saddle here for a spell,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right. Chuck her in the harness room,” the man
said. “Gee whiz, I’m sleepy! I’m goin’ to pound my
ear again.”</p>

<p>Robin gained the railroad station without meeting a
soul. The saddle would be safe for a month, six months,
a year. He was going where he would not need a saddle.
If he didn’t come back to claim it, no matter.</p>

<p>In a dim corner of the empty waiting-room he changed
to his good suit and plain shoes. Then he sat down to
await the west-bound passenger.</p>

<p>This train would go through Big Sandy at six o’clock.
There was little likelihood of any one there knowing that
Mark Steele had passed out of the picture. No one
would dream of Robin Tyler riding boldly west on the
Montana Central through Sutherland’s home town. If
he could get past Fort Benton and Helena without being
recognized he was safe. Detective bureaus did not
flourish in the cow country. Sheriffs had duties
enough at home without going far afield for trouble.
The survivor of a private war who quietly left for
parts unknown was seldom troubled by the authorities in
a distant state.</p>

<p>Robin banked on that. He would go far and he would
never come back. It would be a closed chapter. Sitting
in that dimly lit room he felt no fear of consequences, no
pang of remorse, only a strange touch of sadness. He
hadn’t wanted it to be that way. Six months earlier he
had looked forward confidently, joyously indeed, to a
future in the shadow of the Bear Paws, a future that
comprised round-up and wild riding, a bunch of cattle of
his own, a home on Little Birch&#8212;and Ivy to make that
home bright. He had loved the sight of the hills in
summer, the pressure of the wind on his face as he rode.
Life had been pleasantly compounded of hope and ambition
and love, the regard of his fellows and a singular
sense of oneness with his environment.</p>

<p>He shook himself out of this brooding. It made him
ache. It was done, finished. He might drift eventually
to other cattle ranges but he would never ride the Bear
Paws again, he would never sit on Chase Hill at sundown
and watch the afterglow rose-pink on Old Centennial.</p>

<p>And he would not listen again to May Sutherland’s
throaty voice. Robin was conscious enough of his mental
processes to wonder why he thought of May Sutherland
now instead of Ivy, why the image of the one who
had wept bitter tears on his shoulder six hours ago grew
obscured by a sharp-cut vision of the other sitting on a
sorrel horse looking wide-eyed into the west where the
plains rolled like the sea.</p>

<p>May would have understood how a man might be
caught in a vicious circle and forced to play the only card
he held. He doubted if Ivy did.</p>

<p>Anyway, it didn’t matter, Robin assured himself
morosely. Neither woman could count for much now.
He was to all intents an outlaw. Before long there might
literally be a price on his head.</p>

<p>He kept his face to the window on the opposite side
of the car when the train hauled up at Big Sandy station.
Dawn was breaking when the Fort Benton stop
came. Beyond Fort Benton Robin breathed easier. Once
the train passed Great Falls and bore up into the foothills
of the Rockies he shook off his wariness and began
to view the country with interest. He was in a new
country already and the lure of the unknown began to
exert its spell.</p>

<p>Robin was for the coast, the far Pacific which he had
never seen. He had little of the landsman’s curiosity
about the sea, but he knew that no one would dream of a
cow-puncher with a killing behind him planting his stakes
on Puget Sound. He had bought a ticket on the train.
As that read, Helena was his destination. Helena was
at once the state capital and the winter rendezvous and
residence of many cattlemen, Sutherland among them.
On any street corner he might meet a man he knew. So
Robin kept on to Butte. He could make a detour and
get back on the main line at a junction west of the continental
divide.</p>

<p>Thus he avoided a stop in the last place where he
might be recognized. Twelve hours later he was forging
along the Hell Gate river, the Rockies behind him, the
world ahead of him, a ticket to Seattle and three hundred
dollars in his pocket.</p>

<p>The sun blazed in the car windows. The valley beside
the track, the hills, the farther higher mountains glittered
with frost and snow. Robin with his nose to a pane
reflected that it might be worse. They might be burying
him instead of Shining Mark. And when a man died
he was a long time dead. Thus he comforted himself as
the train rolled west.</p>

<p>A porter sonorously announcing luncheon reminded
Robin that hunger could be appeased in the dining car.
He had eaten coffee and hot cakes early that morning at
a chophouse in Silver Bow. He brushed his hair and
followed the porter.</p>

<p>In the second Pullman to the rear he brought up in
the doorway with a start. Three seats ahead, facing him
wide-eyed with surprise, sat May Sutherland. A broad
pair of shoulders surmounted by a thick red neck informed
him that Adam Sutherland was her vis-a-vis. For
a moment Robin’s eyes met the girl’s inquiring stare.
Then he swung on his heel and went back to his seat. The
world was too small. There would be no food for him in
that dining car. He did not dare run the gauntlet.</p>

<p>For an hour Robin chafed in his seat. Here were
both disturbance and danger. The mere knowledge that
May was within speaking distance troubled him in a vague
fashion. And if Adam Sutherland laid eyes on him! By
now the owner of the Block S must have been informed
of what had befallen Mark Steele.</p>

<p>Robin looked up from these reflections to find May at
his elbow, smiling uncertainly. He rose. For the life of
him he could not help a slightly apprehensive glance past
her. She seemed to divine his thought.</p>

<p>“Dad’s having a smoke back in the observation,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Will you sit down a minute?” Robin bethought himself
of courtesy. May slipped into the seat facing him,
looked at him with a sober intentness.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>Robin stared. Either she knew what had happened, or
her intuition was uncanny. What difference did it make
to her?</p>

<p>“How do you know anything has happened?” he countered.</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>know</i>,” she replied slowly. “But I have that
sort of feeling. When you came to our car and turned
back. Perhaps it was that. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Robin’s mind worked fast. If word had reached Adam
Sutherland and Sutherland discovered he was on that
train, old Adam would have an officer at his elbow between
stations. He doubted if May would mention his presence.
Yet she might. She <i>was</i> frank. Robin couldn’t associate
her with deceit or subterfuge. But if he asked
her not to mention him she wouldn’t&#8212;only he would have
to tell her why. And why not? She would learn eventually.
Robin felt that he would rather she learned from
his own lips. He remembered with a queer glow that she
had said: “If there is to be a funeral I hope it will be
his.”</p>

<p>“I’m on the dodge,” he said quietly. “Mark Steele
jumped me day before yesterday. I killed him. That’s
why I backed out of your car. I didn’t want your dad
to see me. I’m quittin’ Montana for good.”</p>

<p>He put his hands on his knees and faced her impassively,
curious to see how she would take it. A little gleam
of admiration warmed him. She had nerve, this slender
wisp of a girl. She neither winced nor looked shocked
nor did any of the things a woman might reasonably be
expected to do when a man calmly informs her that he
has taken another man’s life.</p>

<p>“Somehow, I don’t seem to be surprised much, nor
horrified, nor sorry,” she murmured at last. “I suppose
he crowded you into a corner. But do you have to run?
Haven’t you a plea of defense?”</p>

<p>“Not much, as it stands. And I’d need a good one,”
he told her soberly. “You see Steele kept diggin’ into
me all fall. He wanted me to jump him so that he could
kill me. He drove me crazy that day in Big Sandy. I
said before twenty men that I’d kill him. The kind of
lawyers and the kind of witnesses that would be against
me in a trial would cook my goose. There’d only be my
word that I had to get him or he would have finished
me. This Thatcher was there. He’ll have his own story.
He’s just as keen to put me away as Shinin’ Mark was.
All things considered I can’t stand trial. I was born
free,” he ended a little wistfully, “I’ve lived free and I
aim to die that way. I won’t take no chance on lookin’
through bars like a caged wolf for doin’ somethin’ that
was forced on me.”</p>

<p>“There is more than Ivy Mayne back of this,” May
said slowly. There was a peculiar sort of conviction in
her tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Robin admitted. “But it don’t do no good to
talk about that now. Too late.”</p>

<p>May rose.</p>

<p>“I must go back,” she said. “We are on our way to
visit friends. We get off at Missoula. Is there any
message I can take back to&#8212;to any one, when I go home
in the spring.”</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“Remember me to the hills when you go ridin’,” he muttered.
“That’s all.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes clouded.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered, and held out her hand.
“Good-by, Robin Tyler&#8212;and good luck to you.”</p>

<p>Robin turned his face to the frosted window. There
was a blur in his eyes as well as on the pane. A lump in
his throat grew and swelled till it seemed as if it would
choke him.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXV' title="XV—ECHOES FROM AFAR">
<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER XV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>ECHOES FROM AFAR</span>
</h2>

<p>Sitting on a pierhead jutting from the Seattle water
front one Sunday afternoon in April Robin surrendered
himself to a mood that he had been choking down all
winter.</p>

<p>Materially he had done well enough. He had sought
sanctuary in this seaport city and found what he sought.
He had walked the streets with an assurance that he was
lost in the swarming ant heap. So far as Montana, the
Block S, those far wide ranges went, he had ceased to
be. And since he had not come there seeking glory and
fortune by the white-collar route he had soon found
work that he could do and for which he was well
paid.</p>

<p>But he didn’t fit. He was an alien in an alien land.
These people did not speak his tongue. His ways were
not their ways. Even now the lessened rumble of Sunday
traffic beat on his brain, a faint distasteful sound,
which in midweek roar annoyed and irritated him with its
clang of complicated machinery, its feverish scurrying of
crowds&#8212;there seemed no more purpose in this medley
of unrest than there was in the senseless milling of a herd&#8212;except
that the human herd went surging this way and
that under the constant pressure of the invisible riders of
necessity.</p>

<p>Here on this April afternoon the sun shone on rippling
water at his feet. The surrounding hills and Sound
islands all washed clean by drenching rain were bright
with spring growth. For weeks, for months, Robin had
lived and moved under the gloom of murky skies, great
clouds that wept eternal tears. He had shivered on his
wagon in damp fogs carrying a chill like the clammy
hands of death. The sun was lost in that gloom. It was
all gray, gray sky, gray streets, gray sea. Sometimes
the very soul in him turned gray.</p>

<p>He was too far from all that he had known and cared
about. Voluntary exile he might have endured with better
grace, knowing that he could return if he wished.
But he could not go back. If he could not go back to
places and things he knew he did not care where he
went.</p>

<p>So chafing, he could not fit himself in here. Sometimes
he said to himself that it was all in his mind, that men
and women, work and pleasure were the same anywhere.
Only he couldn’t make that a reality for himself in
Seattle. Such pleasures as he sought only made him sad.
Life flowed about him in a surging stream and he was
like a chip in the swirls. He had laid that feeling of loneliness,
that depressing sense of isolation, to being a
stranger, to living under a sodden, weeping sky that
never cleared to let him see the blue. He had never
known anything but brightness, air that was crystal-clear,
a look that swept to a far horizon. Here the eyes
were in a prison, shut in by streets like canyons, miles of
houses monotonously alike, dark dripping forests that
began where the last suburban cottages lifted among the
raw stumps where logging outfits had taken their toll
of the great trees.</p>

<p>Robin had said to himself that when he knew people,
when spring came, it would be different. It <i>was</i> different.
But the difference took the form of a more acute
nostalgia. Robin had never wandered among the poets,
but he knew spring fever and he was learning in bitterness
of heart the meaning of homesickness.</p>

<p>He turned now to face the city rising above him in terraced
avenues. Smoke from ten thousand chimneys cast
a haze against the soft blue sky. The rustle and noise
and confusion had stilled a little, though not wholly, on
this day of rest. There was a transient hush along the
water front. An atmospheric beauty hovered upon the
Sound. The Olympics stood out blue toward the Strait
of Juan de Fuca. Yet the city faced Robin like a
maelstrom from which he desired to be afar. He was sick
with a subtle sorrow. The medicine to cure him was a
good horse between his legs, a look from some high ridge
out over a hundred miles of grassland all green now and
sprinkled with blue windflowers. There would be mountains
in the distance too; clean, upstanding peaks like
Gothic cathedrals rising, as the Sweet Grass and the Bear
Paws rose, abruptly from the level of the great plains.
The sharp smell of bruised sage, the white tents of a
round-up camp in a creek bottom, the howl of a wolf far
off in the night&#8212;these Robin’s heart suddenly ached for&#8212;and
for something else, that he felt deep within him but
would never admit.</p>

<p>“By God, I’ve a mind to go back and face the music!”
he said aloud. “They can’t hang me. I’d as soon spend
two or three years in Deer Lodge as here.”</p>

<p>Of so little value did freedom seem to him in that moment.
There was more than homesickness. A man’s liberty
is dear but so is pride. Only cowards fled the field.
He hadn’t fought a rear guard action. For four months
that inner sense of shame had been slowly accumulating
in Robin. All that he cared about, his little cosmos in
its entirety, lay under the shadow of the Bear Paws. He
had been stampeded into flight from a danger real enough,
but which he should have faced.</p>

<p>Robin rose from the weather-beaten pile.</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i> go back,” he said to himself. “I’ve had enough
of this. I shouldn’t have run.”</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours he was aboard a Great
Northern train rolling east through a gloomy pass in
the Coast Range. He lay in a berth, his face pressed to
a window pane, watching the dark forest slip by, a
formless blur in the night, listening to the click-clack
of rail joints under the iron wheels. He felt shut
in, oppressed by those walls of dusky timber draped
with mossy streamers, clouds above and a darksome
aisle in the forest down which the train thundered.
No place for a man hungry for bright sun and blue
skies.</p>

<p>At dawn the train dropped into the Yakima country.
The land opened up in wide vistas. Cattle grazed on rolling
hills, dark moving dots on pale green. Robin threw
open a window. He leaned out sniffing. Sagebrush ran
up to the right of way, receded into the distance, silver-gray
in the first sunlight. He could smell it, sweet in his
nostrils as camp fire smoke to an Arab.</p>

<p>He lay back in his berth with a strange sense of relief.
As the sailor sick of shore sights and sounds goes
gladly down to the sea so Robin returned to his own
country.</p>

</h2>

<p>At Havre, Robin found time between trains to cross
the street and find the livery stable.</p>

<p>“I left a saddle here about Christmas,” he said to the
hostler. “A three-quarter rig Cheyenne with a pair of
<i>anqueros</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I recollect. Take a look,” the man replied.</p>

<p>Robin hauled his saddle out of the harness room, borrowed
a sack to put it in and check it as baggage on the
train. He was under way up the branch line within ten
minutes. An hour and a half later he stood on the station
platform at Big Sandy, wondering with a mingled curiosity
and indifference how long it would be before a deputy
sheriff would saunter up and say with a casual wariness:</p>

<p>“Well, kid, I guess you’ll have to come along with me.”</p>

<p>No, in the face of those purple mountains lifting high
in the southeast, the limitless stretch of lonesome Prairie
spreading north to the Canada line, all those familiar
places, the troublesome future didn’t seem to matter so
much. Silent, lonely, sterile here and there, forbidding
at first glance to such as were bred to field and lane and
orchard, the plains wove their own charm about the
hearts of men. All those leagues of grass and hill and
canyon seemed to hold out invisible hands to Robin.
Bright with its vernal garment the land smiled answer
to his eager look as a maiden smiles to a returning lover.</p>

<p>He stood a minute sweeping old horizons with his gaze.
The station agent nodded. No one had arrived. No
one had departed. It was too early in the morning for
loungers. A man from Sutherland’s store took up the
mail sack, said “hello” to Robin. Robin followed
him across the street. He would put up at the hotel.
If he went unmolested for the present&#8212;and that was
likely enough&#8212;he would take horse later and ride to
the Bar M Bar. If they wanted him they could come
and get him. Months in a strange country had taught
Robin that he was not the stuff of which an Ishmael is
made.</p>

<p>The moon-faced Teutonic host of the Bear Paw House
gazed at him blandly over a varnished counter.</p>

<p>“Ach, so,” he said. “You have been away, yes.”</p>

<p>No more. Robin signed the register. From force of
old habit he suggested a drink. Host and guest went
into the bar. Backed by a mirror that reflected polished
glass and decorative bottles a bartender Robin had
known for years said, “Hello, kid,” and set out the drinks.
Robin grew a little puzzled. This was carrying the normal
cow-country nonchalance toward a man who had
been in “trouble” to an extreme. He might have been
gone only overnight, by their attitude, instead of having
jumped the country after killing a well-known man.</p>

<p>He drank, and leaned on the bar, gazing about. A
rider loped from somewhere about the town and dismounted
with a flourish before the hotel. He stalked in,
clanking his spurs. Robin knew him, Jack Boyd of the
Block S.</p>

<p>“Hello, old-timer.” He pumped Robin’s hand and
slapped him on the back. “Where the hell you been all
winter? Have a shot.”</p>

<p>“On the coast,” Robin said briefly.</p>

<p>They drank. Boyd talked. He was a rattle tongue,
no sequence to his conversation. Robin’s wonder grew.
What ailed them all? Were they all with him, and trying
to make him feel at ease, guessing that he had come
back to face trial? Men had done that before.</p>

<p>His gaze for a second turned to the open door. Across
the street a livery barn bulked large. Its double doors
gaped on the brown earth roadway. A man led out a
saddled horse, put his foot in the stirrup and swung up.</p>

<p>Robin stared incredulously. He could see the features
under the gray Stetson. The flash of silver conchos on
saddle, silver inlay on bit and spur, glinting in the sun;
Robin saw these and still could not believe.</p>

<p>He turned to Boyd.</p>

<p>“Who’s that on the black horse?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Boyd left off an argument with the bartender to look.</p>

<p>“You been snow-blind lately?” he laughed. “Your eyes
still full of that Puget Sound fog? That’s Shinin’ Mark.
You know as well as I do.”</p>

<p>“He’s actin’ meaner’n I ever knew him since he got
around,” Boyd added in a lower tone. “Some of these
days, somebody that’s hot in the head and quick on the
draw is goin’ to get him right.”</p>

<p>“Since he got around?” Robin caught at the first sentence,
repeated it in an interrogative tone.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it before you went away? No? Well he got
careless with his six-gun down in the Birch Creek line
camp last winter and shot his fool self. Darned near
cashed in. He was on the bed ground for two months.”</p>

<p>Robin listened, with a loud thumping in his breast, a
feeling of relief that was like a great weight rolled off his
back. He had seen the glaze of death gather in Mark
Steele’s eyes as his knees sagged under him. He had
stood there looking down at the red stain spreading and
soaking into the dirt floor. He had seen Mark lie like
a log for twenty minutes. It had never occurred to
Robin that he wasn’t dead. How could a man, even an
iron-hard man, survive a .45 slug through the base of his
neck, in the region of his wishbone? Yet there he was,
reining in a black horse that curvetted and twisted in
eagerness to be off, while Mark talked to the stableman.
Robin could see his lips move.</p>

<p>The old passion flickered up in Robin’s breast. All the
indignity, the calculated insults, the treachery, Tex
Matthews’ death, Steele’s bold thievery, stirred Robin’s
blood again. The old sores reopened.</p>

<p>So that was how it went? He wondered why. What
had caused Steele and Thatcher to take that tack? Accident!
Didn’t want it known that an unarmed boy had
shot him with his own gun. Vanity? Perhaps. It didn’t
matter.</p>

<p>Tucked within the waistband of his trousers Robin’s
.45 rested against his stomach. He slid his hand under
his coat, felt the curved bone handle of the gun and took
a step toward the door. Boyd’s eyes had been on his
face, in which all unconsciously something of Robin’s
feelings must have been reflected. Boyd caught his arm
as he moved.</p>

<p>“Aw, look. Let him go for this time,” he counseled
cheerfully. “You got all the time there is to carry on
your private war. He’s pullin’ for Lonesome Prairie.
They’re gatherin’ saddle stock. He wanted me to ride
with him but I ain’t quite ready. Pass it up this time,
Robin. Have a drink and let him go. Who wants to
throw lead on a spring day like this?”</p>

<p>Robin laughed. He could scarcely have followed up
that first impulse since at that very moment Shining
Mark gave the black his head and broke away in a gallop.
Robin watched him grow small until he was a bobbing dot
on the out trail. Then he said to Jack Boyd:</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll keep for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Let’s amble across to the Silver Dollar,” Jack suggested.
“There’s some fellows over there.”</p>

<p>The afternoon and evening Robin spent was like that
of a prodigal son returned. He had not been in Big
Sandy since the evening he cut his string and went home
full of shame and impotent anger. He had come back
under a cloud. That cloud was dispelled. Here on his
own ground, among his own peers, he passed the first
carefree hours that had fallen to his lot in weary months.</p>

<p>He went to bed at midnight and lay for a few minutes
in the dark room staring at the dim walls, smiling to
himself. He did not care what came next. Shining Mark
was still to be reckoned with. He still had his own word
to make good. But that would be man to man, if at all.
In Robin’s mind the T Bar S and theft still remained a
problem to be solved if he desired to remain in the Bear
Paws. But the outcome of any personal clash with Mark
Steele was something Robin could now accept with composure.
Somehow, in his mind, Shining Mark had shrunk
to normal proportions. Or perhaps he himself had grown.
He couldn’t say. But he knew how he felt.</p>

<p>Robin ate breakfast in the morning, took horse and
rode south, rode with a heart as light as the little clouds
drifting around Shadow Butte. The Butte itself lifted
its cone summit high above him. He rode past it on
ground softened by spring rains, warmed by a spring
sun, green with new grass and speckled with flowers. The
creeks ran clear and strong. The Bear Paws nursed
snowcaps on the highest peaks, white pyramids on a base
of dusky pine. Crows sailed cawing around him. Meadow
larks swung on sagebrush trilling their mating song.
Robin lifted his lusty young voice in a ribald version of
The Spanish Cavalier, a careless horseman chanting as he
rode.</p>

<p>He pulled up a minute on the ridge where he had
watched the sunset with May Sutherland, and the singing
mood passed. It was all different now. His face
turned toward the Bar M Bar. He rode on soberly wondering
what his welcome would be like. He stopped once
more to gaze at the closed door of his own cabin, but
he did not dismount. The new grass was springing thick
in the bluejoint meadow. He smiled. He might have a
use for that place yet.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he rode into Mayne’s. Old Dan himself
stood in the stable door. He stared at Robin,
speechless.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m back,” Robin announced the obvious.</p>

<p>Mayne shook his hand, but there was no heartiness in
his grip.</p>

<p>“You ain’t exactly overcome with joy, are you?” Robin
challenged. “What’s wrong with you&#8212;or with me?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’. Nothin’ a-tall,” Mayne protested. “Only&#8212;well,
things is sorta different, I guess, from last fall.”</p>

<p>“How?” Robin’s tone was curt.</p>

<p>“Aw, hell,” Mayne growled. “I might as well give it
to you straight. Me an’ Mark Steele has buried the
hatchet. He’s bought a half interest in the Bar M Bar.
We was a little wrong about them T Bar S’s. Anyway,
that’s settled. So&#8212;well, you see how it is, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You’ve took Mark Steele in as a partner?” Robin
stared with narrowing eyes.</p>

<p>“Yeah. His old man died in Oklahoma an’ left him
fifteen thousand cash. It come about kinda offhand.
They hauled Mark up here after&#8212;after he got shot down
Birch Creek, an’ we took care of him. He ain’t so bad
when you know him.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Robin said slowly. “So because he has a bunch
of money to put in with you you’ve overlooked a little
thing like him stealin’ your stock. You’ve taken a cow
thief for a partner!”</p>

<p>“That’s tall talk, young feller,” Mayne growled.</p>

<p>“Maybe. But I’ve said it. If it worries you I won’t
talk no more. But you know what I think. Yes, it sure
makes it different,” Robin muttered. “I’ll go see Ivy an’
ride on.”</p>

<p>“You better&#8212;&#8212;” Mayne began, but Robin had turned
his back and was striding toward the house. The old
man stood leaning against the stable wall, twisting his
scraggly mustache, poking absently at the soft earth
with the toe of his boot. His expression was not precisely
a happy one.</p>

<p>Robin stalked through the kitchen. Whether driven
by eagerness or anxiety he did not consider. Of old Ivy
would have run across the yard to meet him. He found
her in the living room sitting beside a window which
commanded the yard. He knew she had seen him. She
rose as he entered but there was no welcome in her eyes.
They were darkly sullen, a little frightened.</p>

<p>Robin didn’t speak. He came up to her, put his hands
on her shoulders, looked searchingly into her face. What
he saw there troubled him with a sudden heart heaviness.
To be near her stirred him deeply. Yet as he looked at her
he knew that something which had linked them close was
gone, extinguished like a burned-out candle.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem noway glad to see me,” he said
gently.</p>

<p>“Did you expect me to be?” she returned. “You never
wrote.”</p>

<p>“How could I, the way things were?” he asked. “You
know I would have sent word. It never struck you I’d
either do that or come back because I couldn’t stay away
from&#8212;from everybody and everything?”</p>

<p>“You ran like a scared coyote,” she said tensely. “An’
you didn’t shoot Mark, after all. He shot himself with
his own gun. You were just scared of him.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well?”</p>

<p>Robin paused on the interrogation. He shook her
gently.</p>

<p>“Are you goin’ to bust everythin’ up between us?” he
asked quietly. “Is <i>that</i> the way you feel? Did I have
to camp right on your trail to hold you?”</p>

<p>“It’s already busted,” Ivy snapped.</p>

<p>She shook herself free of his hands, backed away a
step or two, looking at Robin with a dumb implacable
resentment smoldering in her eyes. She turned to a shelf
on the wall, took something out of a box and handed
it to Robin without a word. It was the little diamond he
had given her&#8212;their engagement ring. Robin held it in
the palm of his hand. A pang of sadness, mingled with
a touch of anger stabbed him.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll do for another girl,” Ivy said spitefully.
“I don’t need it no more.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” he said hotly, and flung the ring into
the dead ash of the fireplace. For a moment they stared
at the puff of ashes where it fell, at each other. The girl’s
lips quivered. Robin turned on his heel and walked out
of the house.</p>

<p>Old Mayne still leaned against the stable wall. Robin
gathered up his reins, turned to ask a question.</p>

<p>“Ivy goin’ to marry Steele?”</p>

<p>He shot the words at Mayne with a harshness that
made the old man start.</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” he said apologetically. “<i>I</i> kain’t help
it.”</p>

<p>“Nobody said you could,” Robin flung over his shoulder
as he reached for his stirrup.</p>

<p>Dark found him sitting with his feet on his own stove,
in a house without food or bedding, thinking, thinking!
To-morrow he would ride back to town. But to-night&#8212;here&#8212;he
was not conscious of hunger nor of physical
discomfort as he sat with hands clasped over his knees with
an ache in his breast and a turmoil in his brain.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was bad for a man to see things too
clearly.</p>

<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER XVII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>A CHALLENGE</span>
</h2>

<p>Before dawn Robin saddled and headed south on the
trail of Red Mike. Minus supper and breakfast he was
hungry. But his mount was fresh and fed with grazing
in the little pasture. Robin was tough. A meal more or
less didn’t greatly matter. And sunrise brought him a
happier mood. Luck also bestowed a double quantum as
if to make up for past niggardliness. Ten miles from the
Bar M Bar he ate hot cakes and coffee with a lowly sheep
herder tending his flock on the northern flank of Chase
Hill. Within an hour of that camp he found his sorrel
horse, ranging as the cow horse at liberty was wont to
range, with a band of the untamed.</p>

<p>The wild bunch broke headlong in the general direction
of the Bar M Bar. Robin fell in behind them. The
direction suited his book. He had a bed roll and a packsaddle
still at Mayne’s, and a cow-puncher’s bed was part
of his working outfit. He would need that bedding.</p>

<p>So he loped behind the wild horses until they ran themselves
out. Once Robin caught up and jogged at their
heels he headed them where he wished. With rope ready
he watched his chance. A touch of the spurs, a deft
throw, and the rawhide noose closed about Red Mike’s
burnished copper neck.</p>

<p>Robin led him on to Mayne’s, changed his saddle to
Red Mike’s back and lashed his bedding on the livery
horse. He saw Ivy’s face for a moment at a window.
Her father strolled over to say a word or two. Robin answered
in monosyllables, not because he was still angry
or resentful&#8212;that had all evaporated&#8212;but because there
was nothing more to say. When the last hitch was taken
in the pack rope he rode on.</p>

<p>He slept that night at a horse ranch in the foothills
halfway between Shadow Butte and Big Sandy. Before
noon he was in sight of the town, the pack horse
trotting to keep up with Red Mike’s running walk. He
did not know what he was going to do but that uncertainty
sat lightly on his mind. He had money in his
pocket. An able range rider was welcome anywhere. In
all the long tier of states bordering the east slope of the
Rockies a man who could ride and rope could be a rolling
stone and still gather moss. If the Bar M Bar and
the Block S were both taboo there was still the Bear Paw
Pool, the Shonkin, the YT and the Circle within a radius
of seventy miles. He did not have to quit Montana, only
that immediate section of the Bear Paw mountains&#8212;and
that merely because he chose, because the south side
of the hills had grown distasteful as well as dangerous.
On the latter count alone he would not have retreated.
He was not even sure he would leave. He would never
run again. Once was enough.</p>

<p>But still he was minded to leave Birch Creek and Little
Eagle and Chase Hill, all that varied region he had
haunted for three happy years. Robin wanted to go
clean, to be rid of every tie. Most of them were broken.
There remained only that hundred and sixty acres which
he had dreamed of making a home. He would sell it if
he could, for what he could get. Since the Block S was
the only outfit that set any store by land Robin thought
he might sell it to Adam Sutherland. Looking far-sightedly
into a future that should long outlast himself
Sutherland had increased his acreage as his herds increased.
Sutherland would give him something for that
homestead, although old Adam owned thousands of acres
he had got for a song and sung the song himself. Robin
didn’t want to see it again. Shining Mark in partnership
with Dan Mayne. Mark marrying Ivy. Pah!</p>

<p>Yet in spite of these dolors riding across earth that
exhaled the odor of new growth under a sun blazing
yellow in a sapphire sky, Robin’s spirits gradually rose.
A man couldn’t be sad in the spring astride of a horse
that bounced under him like a rubber ball. Robin
whistled. He sang little snatches of song. He pulled
up on a hill to stare across the flat in which Big Sandy
lay. Space and freedom! Room to move and breathe&#8212;and
some to spare. The sunrise plains before they were
fenced and trammeled. A new, new land but yesterday
wrested by the cattleman with his herds from the Indian
and the buffalo. Robin could not wholly and consciously
visualize the old wild west of which he was a part. He
could only feel instinctively that as it was it was good.</p>

<p>Concretely his mind turned upon matters of immediate
concern. Below him, where Big Sandy creek debouched
from the rolling country he saw tents and
wagons and a cluster of horses.</p>

<p>“Aha,” he said to Red Mike, “there’s the Block S.
They’re in off Lonesome Prairie. They’ll be draggin’
it to the home ranch to get organized for round-up. I
reckon Shinin’ Mark’ll be in town.”</p>

<p>It was out of his way to swing over to the Block S
camp. He had no qualms about bearding the wolf (Robin
couldn’t think of Mark Steele as a lion; a lion in his
mind had a certain majesty) but he saw no reason for
seeking the wolf in his own lair. Town would do as well.
He had no desire to avoid Shining Mark. In fact he had
a certain curiosity about what Mark would do or say
when they met. To Thatcher he gave scarcely a second
thought.</p>

<p>He stabled his horses. By the hitching rack before the
Silver Dollar a row of cow ponies drooped their heads in
equine patience. Robin walked into the saloon. His
gun was belted on his hip, the first time he had ever
carried a six-shooter openly in Big Sandy. Steele was
not there. Block S men, Jack Boyd among them, greeted
him hilariously. Thatcher alone neither spoke nor smiled.
Robin looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said casually, “if there’s anything on your
mind I’m listenin’.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much besides my hat,” Thatcher made a
feeble effort at grinning. “I’m not lookin’ for trouble&#8212;unless
you are.”</p>

<p>That was fair enough in all outward seeming, and
Robin felt that Thatcher, for whatever reason, spoke
the truth. Most decidedly Tommy Thatcher was not
keen for trouble. He showed that plainly enough. It
didn’t occur to Robin that his own attitude was aggressive,
that he was taking a wild bull by the horns with a
confidence that made the bull give ground. Thatcher’s
words and bearing simply gave him an opportunity publicly
to close that incident in so far as it could be closed.</p>

<p>“I never went lookin’ for trouble in my life,” Robin
said quietly. “I side-step it if I can. If I can’t&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come on, have a drink an’ let her slide,” Thatcher
proffered the peace symbol of the range. Men with bad
blood between them didn’t drink together.</p>

<p>“It happens I’m not drinkin’ to-day, not with anybody,”
thus Robin announced to all and sundry that he
was not refusing the olive branch merely because it came
from Thatcher&#8212;although he would have died thirsty
rather than drink with a man he felt sure had sped one
of the bullets that snuffed out Tex Matthews’ life.
“Thanks, just the same.”</p>

<p>Probably no one but himself detected the sardonic note
in that phrase of declination.</p>

<p>He walked on up toward the store. He didn’t know
Mark Steele’s whereabouts and he cared less. He wanted
to see Adam Sutherland. The old man was in town. If
in seeking the owner of the Block S he ran across Shining
Mark that was as it happened.</p>

<p>He didn’t have to ask a clerk if Sutherland was about.
Back by the bookkeeper’s desk Sutherland occupied his
favorite roost deep in an armchair. The cattleman’s
face, round and red about a walrus-like mustache didn’t
alter its normal placidity as Robin approached.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid,” he greeted. “I haven’t seen you for quite
a spell.”</p>

<p>“No, and you maybe won’t see me for quite a spell
again,” Robin answered, “if I can do some business with
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, shoot,” Sutherland encouraged.</p>

<p>“It’s nothin’ much,” Robin said, “except that I’ve been
away for quite a while. Since I’ve been back and looked
the ground over I reckon I’ll move on again. Nobody
loves me and I’m out of a job,” he finished with a whimsical
twist. It was true, but a truth so stated that it contained
for Robin the germ of humor. “I thought maybe
I’d sell you that hundred and sixty I homesteaded on the
creek above Mayne’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you? You reckon I’m in the real estate business?”
Sutherland rumbled. “You got your deed to it?”</p>

<p>Robin nodded.</p>

<p>“How much you reckon it’s worth?”</p>

<p>“As much as I can get for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I might&#8212;&#8212;” Sutherland stopped abruptly.
Robin saw the change of expression cross his face. He
heard the front door click. Out of one corner of his eye
he saw Shining Mark come striding down between the
counters.</p>

<p>“You might what?” Robin prompted.</p>

<p>But Sutherland clasped his hands over his rotund
stomach and leaned back in his chair, silent and expressionless
as a poker player nursing a pat hand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tyler.”</p>

<p>Robin turned his head at Mark’s greeting. The quality
of the man’s voice was the same, arrogant, subtly menacing.</p>

<p>Robin didn’t even trouble to reply. He looked at
Mark calmly, an outward, deceptive calm for within
something was beginning to burn, a flame that he knew
he must keep down. It was like being too close to a
venomous snake&#8212;only, somehow, for Robin the snake’s
fangs were drawn. He didn’t know why he felt so sure
of that but he did. He was no more afraid of Shining
Mark than he was afraid of Sutherland’s elderly bookkeeper,
who was mildness personified, years of clerical
work and domestic infelicity having rendered him harmless.
He gazed at Mark with deliberate, insolent scrutiny.</p>

<p>“They tell me you had an accident with your gun
down on Birch,” he said at length.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Fool thing to do,” Steele growled. It struck
Robin that Shining Mark was a little uneasy.</p>

<p>“Shot yourself with your own gun, eh?” Robin drawled.
“Right in the wishbone, they say. Too bad it wasn’t
about six inches higher. Seems like I heard, too, that it
wasn’t quite accidental.”</p>

<p>“What you tryin’ to do? Provoke me?” Steele asked
coolly. “You act like you wanted to open up a package
of trouble. I’d sure accommodate you on the spot if I
was heeled. You act real bad when you happen to find
me unarmed.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar as well as a thief,” Robin took a step
toward him. “Do you want me to prove it?”</p>

<p>Shining Mark’s face flamed. He looked at Robin, then
at Sutherland sitting quietly in his chair, an impassive
listener save that his eyes were narrowly watching both
men. Mark stared at Robin. That youth laughed aloud
in his enemy’s face. A whimsical thought took form in
a play on words&#8212;steel had lost its temper!</p>

<p>“You’re weakenin’, Mark,” he taunted. “I’ve just
come in from Mayne’s ranch. I said you were a liar and
a thief. I say it again.”</p>

<p>“I heard you,” Steele replied, making a visible effort
at self-control, although his lean face was burning. “You
don’t need to say anything to me at all. I’ll drop you in
your tracks as soon as I get my hands on a gun, you
mouthy pup. You sure do swell up when you happen to
have a six-gun on your hip and catch me barehanded.”</p>

<p>“I beat you barehanded once, and I can do it again,”
Robin kept his voice low, his tone casual. “I don’t reckon
you understand why I called you a liar. I know a Texas
trick or two myself. You&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>He darted a forefinger at Mark and the man jumped
backward&#8212;but not so quickly that Robin’s fingers failed
to tap smartly against something hard and outline it
briefly under Steele’s coat.</p>

<p>“You got a gun in a Texas holster under your arm,”
Robin said contemptuously. “And you talk about being
unarmed. As if anything you could say or do would
throw me off my guard for a second. You swine! When
I think that you put the fear of God in me once, I could
laugh. <i>That’s</i> how dangerous you look to me now.”</p>

<p>Robin took off his soft Stetson and slapped Mark
across the face. Mark put up his hand and backed away.
Behind him Robin heard Adam Sutherland grunt, heard
the scrape of his chair legs. Robin laughed again. He
remembered the dead cows in Birch Creek. He remembered
Tex Matthews’ stiffened body across a bloody
saddle, borne by a tired horse, led by a tired rider through
a long winter night. He remembered with a bitter clearness
Steele swinging his spurred foot from a table in a
line camp and saying cold-bloodedly, “I hate to muss up
a perfectly good camp but you’ve bothered me long
enough.”</p>

<p>With those pictures blazing bright in his memory
Robin had to laugh&#8212;or cry. He did laugh, looking
straight into Steele’s burning eyes, but there was no
mirth in the sound.</p>

<p>“I’ve said my say,” he kept his voice without passion.
“If a gun under your arm isn’t good enough for you, go
buckle one on your hip. I’m not even going to bother
looking for you, Steele. That’s how much I think of you.
I won’t waste no time nor talk on you after this. If
you want my scalp&#8212;and you’ve been after it a long time&#8212;you’ll
have to come after me. If you jump me you
won’t be able to say it was an accident with your own gun
a second time.”</p>

<p>Steele turned and walked away. Once he hesitated,
seemed about to turn. Robin stood watching him, one
hand resting on the desk, a half-smoked cigarette in his
fingers. And when Steele passed through the swinging
doors Robin followed, his thought and vision so concentrated
on the man ahead that he did not hear Sutherland
call after him:</p>

<p>“Hey, Tyler. Come back here. I want to talk to
you.”</p>

</h2>

<p>About Shining Mark’s capacity for ruthless action
Robin had no illusions whatever. He did not jump to the
conclusion as a lesser man might have done that his open
defiance of Steele had driven him to a cover from which
he would not emerge. Mark was pretty deeply committed
one way and another, and he was growing more
cautious, that was all. Robin had simply put him on the
defensive. Mark would get him when and where he could.
After that exchange before Adam Sutherland, Shining
Mark had to go through with it; he couldn’t hold up his
head before his employer if he didn’t. Robin knew that
when he deliberately called him “thief.” That was why
he uttered the epithet. He meant to put the shoe on the
other foot, make Mark the aggressor if war must ensue.
And he had succeeded. The mere fact that certain fibers
within him had hardened so that he neither feared Steele
nor any other man did not lead Robin to underestimate
his enemy. Shining Mark was more dangerous than ever,
for all he had backed up from an insult with a gun hidden
under his armpit.</p>

<p>So Robin took no foolhardy chances. He went to the
hotel, lounged in the bar and the office, and kept his eyes
about him. Two or three of the Block S riders wandered
in. There was nothing to indicate that they had heard
of any new clash. Robin chaffered with them, but he
did not cross the street. He had said his say. The rest
was up to Mark.</p>

<p>Watching idly through a window half an hour later
Robin saw Mark mount his horse and ride to the store,
emerge therefrom presently and jog down the street
looking neither to right nor left, vanishing at last toward
the round-up camp.</p>

<p>Robin ate supper, played cards until ten o’clock, went
to bed. In the morning he saddled Red Mike and rode
south a mile or two. The Block S outfit was gone. Robin
rode west toward the mountains to see a rancher he knew.
He had all the time in the world. He meant to stay
around Big Sandy two or three days. He would sell
that bit of land to Adam Sutherland if he could. Then
he would drift. He would go on spring round-up with the
YT or the Pool. One of the big outfits would make a
place for him he knew. If later his trail crossed Mark
Steele’s&#8212;well, he would never eat his words.</p>

<p>In the evening he went back to town. When he walked
into the hotel the rotund host said:</p>

<p>“Sutherland, he send the Chinaman for you. He want
to see you by his house ven you come in already.”</p>

<p>Robin walked over to the Sutherland cottage. Sutherland
stood on the top step rolling a cigar between his
lips.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Come on in. Still chilly in the evenin’s.”</p>

<p>Robin sat down in an upholstered chair in a comfortably
fitted, homelike room. Sutherland stared at him for
a minute.</p>

<p>“You’ll know me, I reckon, next time you see me,”
Robin suggested dryly. That appraising stare ruffled
him a trifle.</p>

<p>Sutherland grinned.</p>

<p>“I reckon I will,” said he. “What possessed you to
jump on Mark Steele roughshod?”</p>

<p>“He had it coming,” Robin defended. “Anyway, I
didn’t jump him. I just told him where he got off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he got off all right,” Sutherland
grumbled. “Now what’s the root of this trouble between
you and Mark Steele? Strikes me it’s more than a girl.
Twice you’ve called him a thief. I got a right to know.”</p>

<p>“You have,” Robin admitted frankly. “But I’m not
goin’ to tell you, right now. You’d have only my bare
word. If I had a round-up crew to myself for a couple
of months I might be able to <i>show</i> you.”</p>

<p>“Is it that serious?” Sutherland asked slowly.</p>

<p>Robin looked at him keenly. He couldn’t quite make
out this heavy-faced man whose brain was of a vastly
different quality from his flesh-burdened body or he would
never have become a power in the Bear Paws. Sutherland
wasn’t stupid. Neither was Robin. Only Robin
didn’t want to talk, now that he had a hearer&#8212;where
six months earlier he would have poured out his tale.</p>

<p>“Do you know that Steele has bought in with Dan
Mayne?” he asked Sutherland.</p>

<p>Sutherland nodded. His eyes were on Robin narrowly.</p>

<p>“This got something to do with Bar M Bar stock, this
trouble between you two?”</p>

<p>“Partly.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to want to talk.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Robin said bluntly. “If I had a chance I
might show you.”</p>

<p>“All right, you can show me. I’m from Missouri.”</p>

<p>“How?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>“Well,” Sutherland drawled. “You can go to work
for the Block S for one thing. You said nobody loved
you and you were out of a job. I’ll give you a job.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t work for the Block S, as things stand,”
Robin said impatiently. “You know that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see why. You’re a cow-puncher. I can use
you.”</p>

<p>“See here,” Robin told him bluntly. “I’ve ideas of my
own. The only way I’d ever work for the Block S would
be to run it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Sutherland said abruptly. “I’ll give you
a whirl at being a range boss. Mark Steele has quit me.
Think you can fill his boots? It’ll take a man.”</p>

<p>“I fill my own boots,” Robin answered slowly. “That’s
good enough.”</p>

<p>A slow smile spread over Sutherland’s broad face.</p>

<p>“You’ll be the youngest wagon boss in Montana, I
reckon,” he drawled.</p>

<p>Robin didn’t answer. But his heart leaped within him.
To attain the seat of the mighty at a single bound! It
seemed incredible. He had made a reckless statement
bear rich fruit. When he told Sutherland that the only
way he would work for the Block S would be to run it he
had been sincere enough; but that was only an oblique
way of stating that he didn’t want to be a Block S rider
as matters stood. This was a horse of a different color.
When it came to that he was a cowman. Responsibility
had no terrors for him. If he could handle men? Well,
why not? Power is a sweet morsel for any man to set
his teeth in. Robin had confidence without vain conceit.
He knew himself equal to the job.</p>

<p>Sutherland mused, pulling at his walrus mustache, his
rubicund face glowing behind the smoke cloud of his cigar.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he continued. “You’ll be the youngest
wagon boss in Montana. I’m kinda disappointed in
Mark. He was a slashin’ good cowman. Maybe gettin’
some money left him has spoiled him. He’s quit. Least
that’s how I take it. He drew all the money he had
comin’, put Jack Boyd in charge of the outfit, and got on
the train this afternoon. So you go out an’ take charge.
The wagons’ll be camped by the ranch. I’ll give you
a note to Jack.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Robin said quietly.</p>

<p>“Now look,” Sutherland continued. “I don’t want you
to take up with the idea you’ve scared Mark Steele outa
the country, because that’d be a bad mistake. If he didn’t
have it out with you right then and there he had his own
reasons besides bein’ afraid to take a chance. Mark’s got
a money interest on this range now. He’ll be back. I’d
be watchful,” Sutherland said very slowly, “if I was you.”</p>

<p>Robin had no mind to contradict that. He merely
nodded.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to crowd you,” the old man went on in
the kindliest tone Robin had ever heard him use. “I ain’t
got to be near sixty and own thirty thousand cattle by
goin’ through the world blind, deaf and dumb. Maybe a
man here and there fools me for awhile. See you don’t.
If I trust a man and he knifes me, I don’t forget. You
say you can show me somethin’ if you have a round-up
crew to work with. Well, you got it. And I’m from
Missouri. I’m waitin’ to be shown.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk big,” Robin murmured. “I’m
kinda dizzy right now. But when I spread my hand on
the table I think you’ll say it’s good.”</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>On a ridge overlooking the home ranch on Little Eagle,
Robin drew rein for a look. The painted roofs of barn
and out buildings and rambling house glowed in the sun.
Windows flashed like beacons. The willows fringing creek
and irrigating ditch were one shade of green, the wide
meadows another, the pines that clothed the hills above
still a darker hue. And there were the white tents of the
round-up glistening against the sward, the scattered
grazing horses. He could hear far off the sweet tinkle of
bells. His outfit! The youngest range boss in Montana.
Twenty riders, thirty thousand cattle, a thousand square
miles of range under his hand! Robin could have
whooped. Yet there was a sobering effect in the magnitude
of his task. It wasn’t simple. There were added
complications no one knew but himself, himself and Mark
Steele and Tommy Thatcher. Perhaps Adam Sutherland
shrewdly guessed that where so much smoke arose there
must be fire.</p>

<p>Robin looked away down Birch Creek toward the Bar
M Bar, thinking of Ivy Mayne being urged along a way
that promised unhappiness, driven by impulses her dumb
sullen heart could never fathom. Robin had lived all
his young life close to nature, striving with nature. He
had no bookish sophistication, but he was keenly alive,
his mind kindled easily. He had a keen sense of the remorselessness
of natural law. Nature’s ways were sometimes
dark in getting her business done. The individual
wasn’t so much, just as a single animal in a herd was of no
great consequence&#8212;but the herd counted. The pain and
passion of mating and begetting and dying were no mysteries
to Robin. What he didn’t know he could dimly
grasp. Passion was sometimes wrapped up and obscured
in material complexities. Conflict was inherent in life itself,
from the time a man drew his first breath until he
breathed his last.</p>

<p>Looking away toward that hidden ranch he could
visualize Ivy with Mark a sinister figure in the background.
He felt sorry for her. In the same breath he
wondered if May was at the home ranch. Somehow he
hadn’t wanted to ask.</p>

<p>He shook himself out of these reflections and rode on.
He had to dip into a coulee, cross a little ridge, traverse
a horse pasture and pass the house to reach the camp.
He dipped into the hollow. As he topped the opposite
crest a head appeared, a head surmounted by yellow hair,
a pair of shoulders clad in a cream-colored blouse. Close
by this figure seated on a flat rock a chestnut horse that
might have been a twin brother to Red Mike stood with
trailing reins.</p>

<p>Robin drew up beside this vision, answered the smile
of greeting, got down and seated himself beside May.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m kinda unexpected,” he observed.</p>

<p>“Not so much,” she told him. “I heard you were back.”</p>

<p>“The boys would talk, I expect,” he remarked. “Still,
I guess I have some news they couldn’t spread.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” she looked curious.</p>

<p>“Might not interest you much, at that,” Robin drawled.
“The Block S has a new range boss.”</p>

<p>“You?” she breathed. Her eyes danced.</p>

<p>“Good guess,” Robin said. “Kinda sudden. I don’t
know which is the most surprised, me or your dad.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” May smiled. Then she sobered. “What
happened to Mark Steele? Did you meet him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I met him,” Robin answered truthfully. “Nothing
happened. Maybe something’ll happen later. I
don’t know. Don’t care.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why he said he shot himself by accident last
winter?” the girl murmured.</p>

<p>“To save his face, I reckon. He’s proud. He don’t
like to be beaten. I did beat him that time.”</p>

<p>May stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>“A girl can stir up a lot of trouble sometimes,” she said.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a girl. I told you that before.”</p>

<p>“There <i>was</i> a girl, wasn’t there,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“There was, but there isn’t no more.”</p>

<p>Robin crinkled his brow. He looked at May intently.
He had refused to discuss that matter even with Adam
Sutherland, until he had some tangible proof of his assertions.
Why should he feel a burning desire to tell
Sutherland’s daughter all about the coil Mark Steele had
woven around him? Yet that impulse was irresistible.
“Can you keep things to yourself?”</p>

<p>“What do you think?” she asked, a touch of color
rising in her cheeks. “Try me.”</p>

<p>Bluntly, baldly, with a cow-puncher’s vivid terseness
of phrase, Robin, sitting on the rock beside her, the embossed
scabbard of his .45 resting against her skirt, told
her the tale from the beginning, from the hour he lay on
the bank below Cold Spring and watched thieves at work.
When he recounted the episode in the Birch Creek line
camp May shivered. When he finished she sat staring
fixedly at the ground, her hands in her lap, the white
fingers locked tight together. Robin bent his head to
peer into her face. Her eyes were bright-wet, troubled.
He remembered the Coleridge of his school days, ruefully.</p>

<p>“Shucks,” he said, “I didn’t mean to be like the Ancient
Mariner, to fix you with my glitterin’ eye and make you
listen to my tale of woe. I shouldn’t ’a’ worried you with
all that stuff.”</p>

<p>“I’m not&#8212;not a worrier,” May whispered. “Only I
can see it all so clearly. I knew there was some good
reason for my hating that man so. It must have been
simply hell for you.”</p>

<p>Robin swallowed something that came up in his throat.
It <i>had</i> been hell. It moved him deeply that this slim wisp
of a girl understood so clearly what it had been like. He
sat silent for a minute.</p>

<p>Then some unreasoned impulse made him put his arms
around her, draw her up close to him. For one long
second May looked searchingly into his face. What she
saw there must have satisfied her, for she smiled. When
Robin’s lips touched hers she returned his kiss with a
pressure that made his heart leap. And then she
snuggled her yellow head against his neck with a contented,
happy sigh.</p>

</h2>

<p>Many a time in the next two days did Robin’s eyes
turn on the King’s castle, sprawling brown and green
and white on its knoll above the ranch buildings. Like a
fire that had been smoldering a long time and broken at
last into flames under the winds of circumstance, so love
burned in his breast, a new love beside which the old one
seemed only a pale flicker&#8212;something feeble, born of propinquity
and unconscious desire.</p>

<p>Yet for all the commotion that made his heart flutter
and set him to dreaming whenever his hands were idle,
Robin did not let the spring grass grow under his feet in
shouldering the new responsibility Sutherland had laid
on him. He set his men diligently attending to the
various details that would enable the Block S to start the
spring round-up as a smoothly functioning machine.</p>

<p>If the Block S riders wondered at the lightning change
in wagon bosses they wondered silently and accepted
Robin at his face value. They knew that he had somehow
beaten Shining Mark and any man who could do
that was to be respected in any capacity. Robin had no
strain put on his authority. The Block S crew knew its
business. They knew a cowman when they saw him.
Robin was born to the range and running a round-up
was only a logical step up.</p>

<p>Wherefore he had no need to either train or watch his
men. Mark Steele had left few loose ends behind him.
There was only the regular routine of getting ready.
Robin had time to burn. Some of it May helped him to
consume. Somehow they did not need to talk much to
achieve understanding. Robin was no fool. He knew
he had his spurs to win. He did not know how Adam
Sutherland would take him as a prospective son-in-law.
When he voiced that doubt to May she only smiled.</p>

<p>“Do you remember saying to me that I’d probably
marry a French count or an English lord and live in a
castle and wear silk dresses all the time?” she teased.
“Do you suppose dad has that sort of ambition for me?”</p>

<p>“Would it make any difference to you&#8212;far as I’m
concerned&#8212;if he had?”</p>

<p>He had his arm around her at that moment. May
looked up into his earnest face.</p>

<p>“Nobody ever quite knows what’s in my father’s mind,”
she answered slowly. “He never gives himself away. He
keeps his own counsel and acts. But I know what’s in
my mind&#8212;and in my heart. He’s been good to me in so
many different ways. But when it comes to this&#8212;there’s
no use borrowing trouble, Robin. Wait and see. I’m
yours. You’re mine. Nobody can get around that.”</p>

<p>“Is it real?” he asked. “Sometimes I wonder if it’s
just a fancy of yours&#8212;or if I’m dreaming.”</p>

<p>She stopped his mouth with a kiss by way of answer.</p>

<p>“I’ll penalize you if you say things like that,” she
threatened. “If it’s a dream I never want to wake up.”</p>

<p>Robin, sometimes when he was alone, would look away
south over the foothills, to the dark line that marked the
course of Birch Creek in which nestled the Bar M Bar,
recalling a dream out of which he had wakened with a
bitter taste in his mouth. But this&#8212;this was different.</p>

<p>He would try to peer into the future. When he did it
seemed unreckonable. There was still a tangle to unravel,
enemies to cope with. Life hadn’t become less complicated
because he was off with an old love and on with a
new.</p>

<p>It became even more complicated before long. At noon
of the third day Adam Sutherland arrived. Robin rode
over from camp when he saw the bay team and top buggy
roll into the ranch yard.</p>

<p>“Come up to the house,” Sutherland invited. “I got to
augur with you awhile.”</p>

<p>They walked across the yard, Sutherland silent and
thoughtful. May met them on the porch. Old Adam
held her at arm’s length admiringly.</p>

<p>“You look like a new twenty-dollar gold piece,” he
said. “The mountain air sure agrees with you.”</p>

<p>Color deepened on the girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“It always did,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em to have lunch ready in half an hour, an’
leave me and Tyler be for awhile,” he said. “I got to go
back to town right away.”</p>

<p>May disappeared within. Sutherland planted himself
in a wicker chair on the porch.</p>

<p>“Well kid,” he said bluntly, “I was a little bit previous
about Mark Steele. Likewise, I’ve made other plans
about you.”</p>

<p>Robin stiffened but said nothing, waiting only with
a touch of uneasiness for what was coming. There was
bound to be a fly in the ointment, he thought morosely.</p>

<p>“Mark hasn’t quit.” Sutherland eyed him a moment
before he continued. “It seems he only went off for a
spell to attend some private business. Likewise, seein’
as he ain’t got no grudge against you, and don’t exactly
fancy havin’ to shoot you up, an’ not proposin’ to quit
the country just because you’re on the war path, he
thought he better give you a chance to cool off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” Robin exploded. “I don’t care two whoops
about Mark Steele’s reasons for anything. Come to the
point. Have you changed your mind about me runnin’
the Block S?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” Sutherland returned unruffled.
“But for good an’ sufficient reasons of my <i>own</i>,” he
stressed the possessive, “I’ve concluded to let Mark run
the round-up on the home range again. I got another
wagon boss’s job for you, though.”</p>

<p>Robin didn’t speak. He couldn’t understand. It
seemed to him like blowing hot and cold. There was a
double disappointment in being deposed before he had
fairly taken up the reins&#8212;and to stand aside for Shining
Mark galled him more than he wished to admit. He rose
and took up his hat.</p>

<p>“Set down an’ listen to me, kid.” Sutherland’s tone
was friendly. Robin didn’t sit down, but he stood to
listen.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing most of us don’t like,” Sutherland
continued. “That’s a man that don’t know his own mind.
Right now you’re thinkin’ I don’t know my own mind.
An’ you’re wonderin’ why. Was your heart set on runnin’
the Block S round-up this spring?”</p>

<p>Robin looked at him for a second or two.</p>

<p>“What’s the difference,” he said at last, “what my
heart might be set on? That don’t spell nothin’ to you.
If you figure Mark Steele is a better man for your purpose
than me, that settles it. But I don’t have to agree
with you, do I?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d kinda like to have you agree with me on
one or two things,” Sutherland commented.</p>

<p>“I ain’t likely to agree with you on anything in connection
with Mark Steele,” Robin declared.</p>

<p>“You might possibly, if you knew exactly what was in
my mind,” the old man said dryly. “You don’t tell all
you know, or think. Maybe other folks has the same
habit. It’s a useful habit at that, sometimes. I’ll say
this much: I’d a little sooner have Mark runnin’ round-up
for me this summer than settin’ around the Bar M
Bar figurin’ out ways of&#8212;well, of gettin’ even with you,
f’rinstance, for steppin’ into his place; an’ other little
things he’s probably got against you.”</p>

<p>“So in order to protect me you’ll let me go before I
have a chance to show you whether I’m any good or not,”
Robin said ironically. “Thanks awful. Maybe you
reckon I need to be spoon-fed awhile yet.”</p>

<p>“If I did I wouldn’t waste no time on you,” Sutherland
grinned. “By gosh, you get sore quick. Didn’t I
say you still had a wagon boss’s job with me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>sabe</i>,” Robin said impatiently.</p>

<p>“Listen, an’ maybe you will,” Sutherland replied.
“Think you could do any good for yourself&#8212;an’ for
me&#8212;if you were turned loose in the Judith Basin an’ Arrow
Creek country with a round-up crew to gather up five or
six thousand head of stock?”</p>

<p>Into Robin’s mind flashed a picture of himself riding
those lonely bottoms south of the Big Muddy, seeking
through bitter weather day after day and finding here
and there what he sought. He remembered the bite of the
frost, the chill of the winter winds, the glare of ice. To
cover that country again with a dozen riders at his
back&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>“Go on,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>“I’ve bought the J7 brand from the Leland estate,” the
old man explained. “It’s to be kept quiet. There’s reasons.
Nobody knows it only the Leland executors, myself
an’ you. It’s not to go any farther until I’m ready
to have it known. I’ll send you to Benton with a letter to
these people. There’s an outfit organized, a hundred an’
sixty saddle horses, some men&#8212;I don’t know how many.
You’ll have to fill up your own crew. Supposedly you’ll
be runnin’ the outfit for the Leland estate, but you’ll be
runnin’ it for me, an’ you’ll report direct. There’ll be
money in a Fort Benton bank for you to draw on for pay
roll an’ runnin’ expenses. You’ll cover the usual J7 territory,
an’ brand up the calves. In the fall you’ll ship out
everything that’s fit for beef. That’s all the instructions
there is just now. You’ll have a free hand.”</p>

<p>“Why&#8212;if you don’t mind me askin’,” Robin put it
directly to his employer, “don’t you send Mark Steele
over the river and let me go through with what you
started me in on here?”</p>

<p>Sutherland leaned back in his chair, folded his hands
across the generous round of his abdomen. He didn’t
alter his placid expression in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>“Darn it,” he said quite casually. “When it comes
to Shinin’ Mark Steele you got somethin’ up your sleeve.
You won’t tell me what it is. Well, I got somethin’ up
my sleeve, an’ I won’t tell you what it is. But I tell you
kid, as I told you in town, that I ain’t lived to be sixty,
I ain’t made my way in the cow business by goin’ through
the world deaf, dumb an’ blind. The reason I send you
instead of Mark Steele into the Judith Basin is because
I think you’re better qualified for that particular job.
Will you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Robin said. “Sure, I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“While you’re workin’ that south country,” Sutherland
continued, “I reckon you better hold anything that
belongs to this side of the river an’ throw ’em across
when you’re through.”</p>

<p>Robin looked at old Adam placidly rolling a cigar
between his lips. For a second he had the impulse to
show his hand, to tell Sutherland wherein the feud between
himself and Mark Steele originated. Somehow,
with Steele coming back to run the Block S he couldn’t
quite. He had called Steele a thief to his face. He
might have occasion to do so again. But accusation
wasn’t proof. Robin hated empty words. There was
proof in plenty across the Missouri. Consciously or unconsciously
Sutherland was placing him in a position
to accumulate that proof in substantial form, in the
shape of T Bar S yearlings and two-year-olds beyond
what the brand could possibly yield.</p>

<p>“You’ll go back to town with me this afternoon,”
Sutherland said. “Mark’s on his way out, an’ I’d as
soon you two didn’t get together, though he promised
he wouldn’t start no fuss. I didn’t want no gun play.
Will you keep your mouth shut an’ your hands in your
pockets if you should see him?”</p>

<p>“If he keeps away from me, yes,” Robin agreed. “You
seem darned anxious to keep peace between us two.”</p>

<p>“Dead wagon bosses ain’t much good to me,” Sutherland
drawled. “Dead wagon bosses an’ dead cows ain’t
much good to anybody. You keep that in mind.”</p>

</h2>

<p>Robin crossed the Big Muddy on a steel bridge at
Fort Benton to take his first look at the J7. He found
the camp on a river flat, introduced himself to a lean,
dark-faced youth in charge, counted his saddle stock
and began to reorganize. Being short-handed his first
task was to engage more riders. Luck came his way.
In a week the J7 was cap-a-pie&#8212;fourteen cow-punchers,
two horse wranglers, a capable cook, wagons stocked
with grub. Then the J7 round-up vanished into the
heart of the Arrow Creek country and Robin flung his
men on circle as he moved from creek to creek.</p>

<p>He rode out of Fort Benton on May the tenth. By
the middle of June he was combing the Bad Lands opposite
the mouth of Cow Creek. Two days before the
Fourth of July dawned he was lying on a bench across
from Birch. For all practical purposes the spring
round-up of the J7 was over. He had covered the range.</p>

<p>He sat now in the burning sunshine on earth so
parched that it was hot to the bare hand, looking over
the J7 day herd&#8212;thinking. The herd had watered, and
taken to its noonday siesta. Two riders lolled in their
saddles on watch, striving to keep awake in that hot noon
silence.</p>

<p>The “reps” who had worked with Robin’s crew all
spring had cut their horses and cattle and gone home. In
that herd under his eye only a few Block S cattle showed,
a few strays of other northern brands. The bulk of those
grazing or resting cattle bore the T Bar S and the bulk
of those T Bar S’s were yearlings and two-year-olds&#8212;the
ripe harvest of two seasons’ industrious stealing.
There was not among them, Robin surmised, thirty
head of the original T Bar S cattle which had been
turned loose south of the Bear Paws. Decidedly Jim
Bond’s herd had shown a miraculous increase.</p>

<p>Robin looked them over and smiled&#8212;smiled and went
on thinking. For two months he had played a lone hand.
Sutherland had given him the briefest outline of work
to be performed and left him alone. Robin had done his
work. He knew he had done it well. And in addition
to legitimate range work the gathering of this T Bar
S stuff had exceeded his expectations. He grinned when
he thought of what his spring gathering might mean to
Shining Mark.</p>

<p>Off in the north the Bear Paws loomed blue out of the
heat haze that shimmered on the plains. Robin gazed
longingly at those distant mountains. He was hungry
for a sight of May. He wanted to talk with Adam
Sutherland. He had a crew of lusty, eager youths who
had served him faithfully and he wanted them to celebrate
the Fourth. He had a fancy for riding into Big
Sandy with those fourteen sunburned riders at his back.</p>

<p>The fruit of his reflection ripened speedily to action.
He rode into camp, bade the horse wrangler bunch the
<i>remuda</i> and catch him a certain horse. He drew aside
Tom Hayes, the hawk-faced rider who had proved himself
a capable second in command.</p>

<p>“I’m going for a little <i>pasear</i> by myself,” he said.
“You move up to the Judith in the cool of evenin’. To-morrow
shove on to the mouth of Eagle Creek. If we
can cross this stuff there maybe we’ll ride into Big Sandy
for the Fourth. I’ll be back sometime to-morrow. If I
don’t,” he added as an afterthought, “you hold camp
opposite Eagle Creek till I do come.”</p>

<p>An hour later Robin was breasting the Missouri river.
He had picked a good water horse. He went in naked,
holding his clothes in a dry bundle above his head while
his mount traversed that half-mile breadth of swimming
water.</p>

<p>He loped past the empty line camp where he had left
Mark Steele sprawled on the dirt floor that cold December
afternoon. It was hot in that sage-floored canyon.
Robin took to the benchland, where cooler airs blew.</p>

<p>In all the broad sweep of Chase Hill and upper Birch
he saw no sign of the Block S round-up. With the Bar
M Bar two miles on his right he bore up into the Bear
Paws and rode a sweat-lathered horse into the Sutherland
ranch at sundown. A stable hand told him Sutherland
was at home. Robin stalked over to the house.
When his spurs clinked on the first front step a yellow
head raised out of a hammock and May came with outstretched
hands and shining eyes to meet him.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long spring,” she whispered. “I’m a
patient creature, Robin, but the time has seemed so long,
so long!”</p>

<p>“And maybe my time with you will be short,” he
answered tenderly. “It all depends. Where’s your dad?”</p>

<p>“He took his rod and went up the creek to catch some
trout for breakfast,” May said. “He’ll be back soon, I
think. Has anything new cropped up? Where have you
been all these weeks, and what have you been doing,
Robin Hood? You vanished so quickly. What happened?
I ask dad, and he merely grins.”</p>

<p>“You got my letters, didn’t you?” Robin asked.
“I wrote twice. I told you I’d gone to run a round-up
south of the river. I didn’t have much chance to send
mail. I’ve been in the Judith Basin and the Bad Lands
all spring.”</p>

<p>“You write dear letters,” she smiled. “But you don’t
give much information about what you’re doing&#8212;only
about how you feel.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that what you mostly want to know?” he
teased. “Don’t you like me to say I love you in as many
different ways as I can set it down in black and white?”</p>

<p>“Of course, silly,” she reproved. “But why didn’t you
stay here and run our round-up instead of Mark Steele?”</p>

<p>“Did your dad tell you?”</p>

<p>“He’s like you,” she murmured. “He thinks and looks
and acts more than he talks. There he is now.”</p>

<p>Adam Sutherland came ambling slowly across the
yard bearing a rod and reel. He nodded to Robin,
opened his basket to show them half a dozen glistening
fish; then he shouted through an open window. A
Chinese house boy came to bear away tackle and trophies.
Sutherland lit a cigar.</p>

<p>“Well, Tyler,” he said. “I expect you want to see me
about something, eh?”</p>

<p>May rose and withdrew, stopping behind her father’s
chair to pat his head with one hand while she blew Robin
a kiss off the other. When they had the porch to themselves
Sutherland turned an impassive eye on Robin.</p>

<p>“I was sort of expectin’ you’d turn up,” said he.
“How’d you get along with the spring work?”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m through except for a day herd we’re
holdin’. The outfit’s movin’ in opposite Eagle Creek
ford to-morrow,” Robin told him. “We’ve covered the
range. Branded out a tally of seventeen hundred calves.
Beef stock is shaping up pretty good in the Basin. Feed’s
good. Looks like it might be a little overstocked, though,
on a dry year. Too many sheep outfits over there.”</p>

<p>Sutherland nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ll move that J7 stuff north next year,” he remarked
absently.</p>

<p>Robin sat silent a moment.</p>

<p>“Look,” he said abruptly. “I’ve got to stir up somethin’.
You asked me twice why I called Mark Steele a
thief. I’m goin’ to tell you why, now.”</p>

<p>Sutherland took the cigar out of his mouth, inspected
critically the ash.</p>

<p>“Shoot,” he said casually. “I’m listenin’.”</p>

<p>Robin began at the beginning, the day he lamed
Stormy, the gray horse, by Cold Spring. He spared
nothing, no one, himself, Mayne, Ivy, Mark Steele. All
that had grown out of Shining Mark’s depredations had
burned in Robin’s breast so long it was a relief to speak
freely. Sutherland sat staring at the porch floor, frowning
a little, forgetting to puff at his cigar. Once or
twice he shifted abruptly in his chair. Once or twice he
stared at Robin with narrowed eyes. Dusk deepened into
dark while Robin talked. The crickets chirped in the
dry grass. Stars twinkled above.</p>

<p>“So all the young stuff that’s been branded T Bar
S and thrown over the river on the ice I’ve got in my
day herd,” Robin concluded. “There is a little over
three hundred head. I expect a round-up of T Bar S’s
on the home range would show a lot more. Short of
killin’ Mark Steele if he jumps me&#8212;and I suppose he
will jump me if he gets a chance because he knows he
isn’t safe with me on this range&#8212;I don’t know as I can
do any more single-handed. I see no way of provin’
Mark owns the T Bar S or any interest in it. I do know
that he and Thatcher rustled those calves. I’ve told
you how. The increase in young T Bar S stuff proves
it. I’m just as sure they shot Tex and tried to get me
as I am that you’re settin’ in your chair. But I don’t
know whether what I know and have guessed would convict
’em in court. There it is. What do you think?
And what do you want me to do with those T Bar S’s?”</p>

<p>Sutherland rose.</p>

<p>“Come on in where there’s a light,” he invited.</p>

<p>He led the way into a room originally built of logs
and now paneled to the ceiling with oak. Robin had
never been inside the Sutherland house before. There
was a homelike air of comfort in this room, a peculiarly
satisfying atmosphere that Robin could feel even if he
did not understand how it was attained. Soft thick
rugs lay underfoot. There were deep, upholstered chairs,
a few pictures on the walls, trophies of Sutherland’s rifle
in the way of deer and elk antlers, and a great bearskin
spread before a yawning fireplace. An oil lamp burned
at each end of the room. Sutherland motioned Robin to
a chair, shoved a box of cigars across an oaken table,
sat down himself and frowned at the floor.</p>

<p>“This ain’t so new to me,” he said at last. “Only it
comes a lot straighter than I expected. Tex Matthews
was my man. I sent him to work for Mayne on purpose.
A man with cows scattered over a hundred miles
square can’t afford to sleep. If you’ve got anything
there’s always some smart feller layin’ awake nights
figurin’ how he can take it away from you. A thief <i>will</i>
steal. Men you trust <i>will</i> go wrong. It seems like&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>He fell silent for a minute.</p>

<p>“I hate it!” he began again presently. “For three
years I trusted him like he was my son. He’s aggressive
and he’s got brains. But I guess it’s the wrong kind of
brains&#8212;the fox kind. He <i>is</i> foxy. If he has laid off
rustlin’ this spring, he’s pretty well in the clear. I can’t
touch him on suspicion. Unless&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>He sat tugging at his drooped mustache.</p>

<p>“Like havin’ a skunk under your house where you
can’t get at him, and you can’t hardly stand the smell,”
he said. “No wonder he wanted to kill you.”</p>

<p>“And you never suspected him?” Robin asked. “If
Tex was your man didn’t he tell you anything? He
knew. And why did you send him to work for Dan
Mayne?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t really suspicious of Mark till this winter,
not till after he was supposed to have shot himself, an’
you jumped the country. I had nothin’ but a hunch
last year that somebody was rustlin’. Tex Matthews
was on the lookout with the round-up. Another man
worked on the outside. I got a notion Mayne might be
draggin’ his rope. That’s why I had Tex edge in there.
Tex told me straight he thought Mark was usin’ the T
Bar S for a blind. I didn’t believe him. Not till he was
dead. I felt kinda bad about that. There’s a big bill
for those two to pay, Tyler. But it’s got to be collected
legal. I don’t want no strangler work on this range,
nor shootin’&#8212;unless deputy sheriffs do the shootin’. The
gun fighter’s day ought to be over. We got organized
law an’ law officers. You keep that in mind when your
trigger finger itches for Mark Steele.”</p>

<p>“My gun hand don’t ever itch,” Robin answered
slowly. “Only if he jumps me, or even acts like he might
jump me, I got a lot of things to remember that don’t
incline me to be peaceful.”</p>

<p>“A man has a right to defend himself,” Sutherland admitted.
“But you have too much chalked up against
Steele to stop at defendin’ yourself. You burn inside
when you face him. I’ve seen it in your eye twice now.
An’ I want him alive,” he finished grimly. “I want to
make him a shinin’ example to cow thieves an’ murderers.”</p>

<p>“Meantime you keep him in charge of your outfit
where he’s got all the chance in the world to do most
anything he wants to do,” Robin said tartly. “I don’t
<i>sabe</i> the play.”</p>

<p>Sutherland smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I want him where I can keep cases on him,” he said.
“Suppose he does get away with a few calves. What’s
a few hundred calves more or less? I’d lose a thousand
head of stock cheerful, to catch a cow thief out of my own
outfit. I’ll get them cattle all back anyway, sometime.
The only question is: How can we nail him an’ Thatcher
dead right?”</p>

<p>An idea which had lurked nebulously in Robin’s mind
for days took definite form in that instant.</p>

<p>“Look,” said he, “you spoke rather peevish a while
ago about trustin’ men. Do you reckon you can trust
me?”</p>

<p>Sutherland looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You <i>got</i> to trust men,” said he. “You wouldn’t be
runnin’ the J7 if I didn’t have a certain amount of confidence
in you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you got better reasons for trustin’ me than
you know,” Robin observed. “Probably I hate a thief
and a crook and a cold-blooded killer worse than you do,
even if I have no stock to be stolen. Anyway, I have an
idea. Will you stake me to about five thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>Sutherland stared at him for a minute, reached into
a drawer and took out a check-book.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he rumbled as he handed over the green
slip, “it ain’t any of my business what you aim to do
with my money?”</p>

<p>“You’ll get good value for it or you’ll get it back.”
Robin grinned. “Now, about this T Bar S stuff? Will
you leave me handle ’em my own way for a while?”</p>

<p>Sutherland nodded.</p>

<p>“One other thing,” Robin continued. “Have you
figured out any move of your own about Shinin’ Mark?
Because I’m apt to try something and we don’t want to
work at cross-purposes.”</p>

<p>“No,” Sutherland shook his head. “I’ve kept close
tab on him an’ Thatcher all spring. They haven’t made
a move except the old game of throwin’ back unbranded
calves, which ain’t criminal until they start usin’ the
iron. Ten years back I’d ’a’ picked my own men an’
treated Mark to a rawhide necktie or shot him like any
other wolf. But takin’ the law into your own hands ain’t
either necessary nor good policy no more. I’ll have to
think over this a while. He’ll keep. When I figure out
a move, I’ll let you know. Meantime, go ahead your own
way.”</p>

<p>“The boys are kinda wishful to celebrate the Fourth,”
Robin said. “I might let ’em ride into Big Sandy.
Where’s the Block S round-up?”</p>

<p>“Finishin’ up on the flats east of town,” Sutherland
told him. “They’ll be in for the Fourth. There’s to be
some sports. I’d as soon you weren’t there, kid. You’re
hot-headed. You might run foul of Mark. He <i>is</i> bad.
Don’t think he ain’t because you made him weaken in the
store that day. I wouldn’t want you to go to hell in a
fog of powder smoke from a cow thief’s gun.”</p>

<p>“I won’t make no such finish. You can gamble on
that,” Robin answered. “Anyway the J7 riders may be
in Big Sandy for the Fourth but I won’t be among those
present. I’ve got a good <i>segundo</i>, Tom Hayes by name.
I’m goin’ to let him run the outfit for a few days. Now,
I’m goin’ to ride. I could use a fresh horse.”</p>

<p>“Tell the stableman to give you old Groaner,” Sutherland
said. “Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>Robin turned in his saddle when he was mounted on a
strapping bay, to look back at the house. A light glowed
in the windows of a room he knew was May’s. He hated
to go without seeing her again. But until the issue between
himself and Shining Mark was settled for good he
could neither give himself up to love nor be easy in his
mind. One thing at a time.</p>

<p>Yet it pleased him to know that Adam Sutherland
treated him without question. Sutherland was right.
Men had to be trusted. Life was impossible without that
faith. If here and there it was betrayed&#8212;no matter.
He hadn’t failed Mayne, for instance; old Dan had failed
him, and so had Ivy. He wouldn’t fail Sutherland.
Riding alone in that dark and silent night Robin wondered
if old Adam or May would draw back, lack confidence,
grow cold, if some deadly pinch came. There
was an uncomfortable chill in the possibility. But it
wasn’t even a possibility, Robin assured himself. Such
a thing was unthinkable.</p>

<p>He shook off that slightly pessimistic mood and
listened to the crickets, marked a waning moon peep
through crevices in the cloud scud that wreathed the sky,
as he covered mile after mile, riding fast and unwearied
in spite of fifteen hours in the saddle. He wanted to
catch his outfit at dawn, before the herd crossed the
Judith River. He knew a way to hold those T Bar S’s
and yet free his riders for a holiday in town. They were
a mettlesome bunch and they liked him; they would back
him in anything. Robin valued that unquestioning
loyalty. He wanted to hold that crew intact for the
fall round-up, if&#8212;the ugly thought rose unbidden&#8212;he
lived to boss the J7 through the autumn months.</p>
</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXI' title="XXI—A MATTER OF BUSINESS">
<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>A MATTER OF BUSINESS</span>
</h2>

<p>From the high level of the plain above the Judith
River Robin looked back, gazing on the scene below and
reflecting on the ease with which a range boss could arrange
things to suit his own convenience, his own purposes.
He knew now why Shining Mark had dared so
much and felt so safe until the simple accident of a horse
lamed and his rider set afoot had betrayed him. If
Steele and Thatcher had not been emboldened by Shining
Mark’s absolute control of the Block S range, they would
never have shot those Bar M Bar cows in order to steal
their calves within twenty miles of home. If they had felt
less secure and been a little more discreet Robin would
never have dreamed the Block S round-up was run by a
thief in his own interest. It was easy to take advantage
of the wide trust and power a cow outfit must necessarily
repose in men.</p>

<p>Adam Sutherland didn’t know what he, Robin, was
doing, what he might do if given full opportunity. It
rested solely on the personal integrity of the man trusted.
The response to that unqualified trust bred at once the
peculiar devotion of the cow-puncher to his salt and by
contrast gave rise to the sweeping depredations that
once in a blue moon shook some individual cattle owner’s
faith in men.</p>

<p>“Here am I,” thought Robin, as his eye dwelt on the
Judith looping silver through a sage-gray and meadow-green
valley in which the PN ranch buildings and the
white tents of the J7 were mere specks, “here am I with
the old man’s check for five thousand in my pocket, another
five or six thousand to my order in a Fort Benton
Bank, and me hellin’ off on a pure gamble&#8212;and the old
man don’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>He smiled soberly. His day herd of T Bar S’s pastured
under fence at the PN by special arrangement.
His riders were off in a body to celebrate the Fourth in
Big Sandy. Robin himself had a destination one hundred
and fifty miles to the west, on a project of his own.
He might fail or he might succeed. Whether he failed
or succeeded, Adam Sutherland would pay the freight.
It was a matter undertaken largely in the interest of his
employer&#8212;but there was also a touch of the very human
motive of helping the piper present a peremptory bill to
the sinister figure whose shadow had been lying more or
less across Robin’s path for a long year.</p>

<p>Robin rode west. In the middle of the afternoon he
dropped into the valley of the Missouri river, clattered
across the bridge and stabled his horse in Fort Benton.
Once his hunger was satisfied he went straight to the
sheriff’s office. A Montana sheriff might be anywhere
in his county at any moment, but luckily Robin found
Tom Coats holding down a chair in his own sanctum.
Robin’s business was simple, requiring only certain explanations
which made Coats open his eyes and readily
promise secrecy and coöperation. When Robin departed
he went as a duly sworn deputy of the Sheriff of Chouteau
county, in the State of Montana, with certain papers in
his pocket and a nickel-plated star to pin on his breast if
he chose to so ornament himself.</p>

<p>For several hours thereafter he cooled his heels in that
little cow town awaiting a west-bound train which landed
him in Helena shortly before midnight.</p>

<p>The hour suited his purpose. Ordinary business flourishes
by day but the busiest and most profitable period
of a saloon keeper’s operations is&#8212;or was&#8212;likely to
occur in the middle of the night. Like any other sound
merchant a saloon man might be expected to attend his
affairs in person during the peak&#8212;so Robin expected to
find Jim Bond behind his own bar at that hour.</p>

<p>Bond, who proved to be elderly, stooped and rather
saturnine in countenance, was totaling up figures at a
desk behind the bar while a white-aproned employee
waited on the customers. He rose to face Robin across
the polished wood.</p>

<p>“Got a back room where we can talk?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>“What kind of proposition you got that you have to
talk private?” Bond asked. He seemed both doubtful
and ill-humored.</p>

<p>Robin looked him coldly in the eye.</p>

<p>“One you might be inclined to listen to, if you got any
interest in money&#8212;or cattle,” he said slowly. “I’m from
Chouteau county.”</p>

<p>Bond led the way to a partitioned-off space in the
rear. In one small room five men in shirt sleeves sat
around a green covered table, fingering chips in a stud
poker game. In another two painted women and a man
had their heads together over a round of drinks. Bond
found an empty cubicle and motioned Robin to a seat.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked curtly.</p>

<p>“You own the T Bar S brand, and you put a hundred
and fifty head of stock on the range south of the Bear
Paws two years ago, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Bond nodded.</p>

<p>“How many cattle you reckon you got down there
now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as that’s any of your affair,” Bond said
disagreeably. “I ain’t exactly sure, and I can’t see why
I should tell you if I was.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to, of course, right now anyway,”
Robin grinned. “Probably I know better than
you do. It struck me that ownin’ this brand ain’t makin’
you rich. I’d kinda like to buy that bunch of cattle.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t for sale,” the man growled.</p>

<p>“Cattle are always for sale if the price is right,” Robin
answered equably. “You put in a hundred and fifty
head. Your natural increase would be about eighty.
On that basis, which is a fair percentage, you’d have
about two hundred and thirty head. I’ll buy the T Bar S
on that estimate, at twenty dollars a head&#8212;let’s see,
that’s forty-six hundred dollars&#8212;cash down.”</p>

<p>“You’re wastin’ time,” Bond made a move to rise.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” Robin said peremptorily. “I ain’t
through.”</p>

<p>Bond settled back in his seat. His expression was not
altogether one of ease.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bond,” Robin didn’t like the man’s shifty
eye and it was easy for him to be harsh, “you’re a saloon
man. You never were anything else&#8212;not in Montana.
You own a registered brand. You send a bunch of stock
into the heart of a big cow-outfit’s range. You never
show up there yourself. You never had a man ride for
you. You don’t know how your calves get branded, nor
how many. Maybe you trust in Providence. If you do
Providence has been awful darn good to your stock&#8212;so
darn good, that I come up here to see you about it.
What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to tell you anything about my business,”
Bond snarled. “I&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“You might <i>have</i> to tell somebody about it one of
these days,” Robin interrupted.</p>

<p>Bond stared at him uneasily.</p>

<p>“There’s something queer about this T Bar S brand,”
Robin went on. “I sometimes dabble in queer things.
I want to own it. I’m offerin’ you a good price&#8212;I’ll
take my chances on gatherin’ what I pay for. In fact I
sort of want that brand for a bait. Will you sell? Better
sell out than get froze out. Forty-six hundred is a
nice bunch of coin all in a lump.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to take you up,” Bond declared. “But I
can’t.”</p>

<p>“That brand’s registered in your name,” Robin challenged.
“You’re goin’ to get into trouble over it.”</p>

<p>“No I ain’t,” Bond defended. “I don’t own it. Never
did.”</p>

<p>“Who does?” Robin demanded.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“You might have to tell a judge and jury,” Robin
said bluntly.</p>

<p>Bond shifted in his seat, visibly nervous.</p>

<p>“Look,” Robin continued. He turned back the lapel
of his coat to reveal the deputy’s badge. “I’m foreman
of the J7 outfit on the Judith side of the Big Muddy.
But I’m a deputy from Tom Coat’s office besides. Tyler’s
my name. I got a blank warrant in my pocket. I don’t
punch cows or be a deputy sheriff for the fun of the
thing. I know somethin’ about this brand you’re supposed
to own. You’ll either tell me who you’re coverin’
up or you’ll go down to Fort Benton on the morning
train. Take your choice.”</p>

<p>“I dassent,” Bond whined. “I don’t know nothin’
about cattle. Never owned a hoof. Havin’ this T Bar S
registered in my name was just a favor to a certain
party. You can’t put nothin’ on me for that.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I? How much did you get for this favor&#8212;from
this party?” Robin jeered. “Talk right out loud,
Mr. J. Bond.”</p>

<p>“A couple of hundred,” Bond admitted, with sullen
reluctance. “But you can’t hang nothin’ on me for that,
either.”</p>

<p>“Men have been hung for less in the cow country,”
Robin said grimly. “Who is this party?”</p>

<p>Bond shook his head stubbornly.</p>

<p>“Hell!” he cried. “Why don’t you grab the cattle
and make him show his hand?”</p>

<p>Robin stared at the saloon man for a minute. Certain
possibilities occurred to him on the heels of that remark.
But he wanted something more definite.</p>

<p>“Spit his name out,” he said harshly. “I can guess it&#8212;but
I want to hear you say it out loud.”</p>

<p>Again Bond demurred. Panic was beginning to show
in his face.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” Robin said and rose. “You come
with me.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t afraid of Bond holding out to the bitter
end. The man was too frightened. And under Robin’s
threatening attitude he weakened instantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord,” Bond threw out both hands despairingly.
“If you got to know, why the feller that owns the T Bar
S, that has owned them ever since that stock went down
to the Bear Paws, is Mark Steele, range boss of the
Block S, Adam Sutherland’s outfit.”</p>

<p>“I expected he did,” Robin answered coolly. “Now
how does he hold title to ’em when you have the brand
registered in your name?”</p>

<p>“I got the brand with money he furnished,” Bond admitted
sullenly. “Then I turned around and gave him
a legal bill of sale. But he didn’t want the brand transferred.
He got me to hold it in my name.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Robin nodded. “An’ what beef was shipped
you collected the money an’ paid it over to Mark. And
so on.”</p>

<p>He drummed on the table reflectively for a few seconds.</p>

<p>“Well, if Mark Steele owns the T Bar S I can’t buy it
from you, can I? You just forget we had this conversation
until&#8212;well, if it should happen that Shinin’ Mark
got into trouble you might have to explain the circumstances
of this bill of sale in court.”</p>

<p>“If he was where he couldn’t get at me, I’d like to
wash my hands of the whole business,” Bond said
morosely. “He was up here this spring threatenin’ all
sorts of things if I ever opened my trap. He was worried
about somethin’. I don’t mind sayin’ I’m scared of him.
He’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe he is,” Robin agreed. “So you better
never admit to him that you told me who owned the T
Bar S. At the same time you better disown that brand.
There’s goin’ to be a mix up over those cattle by and by.
That’s all. So long.”</p>

<p>Robin walked out of the dive. It <i>was</i> a dive, subsisting
on the border of the underworld, betraying its character
at a glance. Robin was glad to get away from
the place. Nevertheless he was glad he had bearded Jim
Bond in this den of iniquity&#8212;which differed from the
average cow town saloon as the floor of a pigsty differs
from a Wilton rug&#8212;because he had gleaned an important
fact or two, and one harassed remark of Bond’s
had suggested to him a plan which he thought worth
trying.</p>

<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER XXII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>A NEAR SHOWDOWN</span>
</h2>

<p>Another rider jogged beside Robin Tyler when he
rode out of Fort Benton the following day, a man about
thirty, a typical cow hand one would say from a glance
at his sunburned face, the easy effortless way he sat his
horse, the completeness of his riding rig. Sam Connors
was a cow-puncher, but he was also another of Tom
Coats’ deputies, a dark horse on the county pay roll,
his status as an officer of the law remaining under cover
for purposes best known to a sheriff whose security in a
political job rested on affording protection to cattlemen
against the occasional marauder who looked too
longingly on stock not his own.</p>

<p>The J7 riders were all in camp. They had feasted,
so to speak, won a roughriding contest in Big Sandy.
They were very well pleased with themselves, with their
wagon boss, with the world in general. They had rested
for a couple of days and now with the impatience of
youth they craved action.</p>

<p>They got it speedily. Robin reached camp at three
in the afternoon. Before sundown he had bunched his
day herd out of the PN pastures and made it breast the
Big Muddy. He threw his horse herd over the river on
the heels of the cattle, ferried his wagons on a scow borrowed
from the PN, and set up his camp on the north
shore.</p>

<p>At daybreak he led his riders on circle. For one week
he shifted camp twice a day and swept the country for
fifteen miles on either side as he moved, so that on the
eighth day he had picked up every T Bar S ranging
between lower Birch and Big Sandy Creek. He had by
actual count over six hundred in his day herd and the
scope of Shining Mark’s operations loomed bigger than
ever. There might be a few more scattered here and
there on the Block S range, but Robin had enough for
his purpose. He reckoned that Shining Mark’s crew
would be taking a lay-off before beef round-up somewhere
near the home ranch. When the swing of his
gathering brought the J7 under the south slope of
Shadow Butte, Robin left Tom Hayes in charge and
rode for the Block S.</p>

<p>He wanted to see Adam Sutherland and he wanted to
see Shining Mark&#8212;he wanted to get them together. He
thought he would explode a sort of bomb and see what
would follow. Mark might stand pat and say nothing&#8212;but
he would do something, either at once or soon after.
He might open war at sight. Robin didn’t know how his
tactics would result. The uncertainty keyed him up a
trifle.</p>

<p>Probably his greatest desire was to see May, to feel
her lissome body rest for a moment in his arms. There
was a greater thrill in that expectation, a more riotous
quickening of his pulse, than in the worst Mark Steele
could do. Love was for Robin a far keener, a more
disturbing emotion than hate&#8212;and he didn’t hate Mark.
He despised him. But despising the man did not, as
Robin knew, make him any less formidable.</p>

<p>Dangerous or not, Mark Steele no longer had the
power to make Robin grow moody as he stared out
across the plains, nor to hush the song on his lips when
he rode. He galloped now through the foothills lilting
one of those interminable ditties every range rider knew,
the saga of what befell a trail herd between the Staked
Plains and the Canada line. The ground was dry and
hot, the grass a crisp brown. All the delicate wild
flowers, the tender green of spring, had vanished under
the brassy glare of a midsummer sun. The streams were
dwindling in their pebbly beds. Yet the old charm of
the plains held good. That wide land had changed its
aspect but intrinsically it remained the same, passing
through its orderly cycle of blazing July heat, to verge
into brown, still autumn&#8212;then white winter, and after
that once more the green and beautiful spring.</p>

<p>Robin came whistling down the slope into the home
ranch. He noted the tents of the round-up on the creek
below an irrigated meadow. He hoped both May and
her father would be at home and not in town. When he
drew up at the porch steps he saw that May, at any
rate, was there. Her yellow head showed at an open
window. She blew him a kiss with both hands and
beckoned him to come in. Robin needed no second invitation.</p>

<p>“You glad to see me?”</p>

<p>“Glad?” The girl threw back her head and laughed
happily. “Oh, Robin, you’re funny. Are you blind?”</p>

<p>Robin’s vision was keen enough. He could see the glow
in her eyes, the flush that warmed her cheeks, and his ears
drank in the note of gladness in her voice.</p>

<p>“Well, I like to hear you say it,” he smiled. “Because
I haven’t much time to make love. I’m a foreign rider
from a distant range and I’ve got to consult your father
on business. Likewise I see the Block S camp on the
creek, so I reckon Mr. Steele may be present, which
makes me keep my weather eye open. Is the owner of the
Block S around?”</p>

<p>Robin was standing with May in the bend of his arm.
He kissed her with the last sentence&#8212;and started a trifle
at the unexpected answer to the last question&#8212;since it
came in the unmistakable deep tones of Adam Sutherland
himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, the owner of Block S is around,” he said. And
after a second in which his daughter and his foreman
looked at him in silence he continued harshly: “And it
looks to me like it stands me in hand to be around.”</p>

<p>May’s head went up. The hand that rested on Robin’s
shoulder tightened a little in its grasp. Her color flamed.
Her eyes took on a different brightness from the soft
gleam that had welcomed her lover.</p>

<p>But Robin found his tongue first, forestalling her.</p>

<p>“You don’t sound very pleased,” he said quietly. “Do
you reckon it’s a crime for a man to love your girl?”</p>

<p>“From what I’ve heard you’re kinda free and hasty
in your lovin’,” Sutherland replied.</p>

<p>Robin’s face clouded.</p>

<p>“You have no right to say a thing like that,” he returned.</p>

<p>“I got a right to say what suits me,” Sutherland declared.
“I don’t know as you’re the man I’d pick for
my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter,” May broke in with unexpected passion
in her voice, “will do her own picking when it comes
to a man. You know that, dad. I’ve told you time and
time again. I’ve been good and obedient in everything
you’ve ever asked of me. But you can’t do my marrying
for me.”</p>

<p>“It’s come to that already, has it?” Sutherland muttered.
He took off his hat and rolled it in his hands.
His glance, bent alternately on Robin and his daughter,
was doubtful. But neither that dubious glance on his
otherwise impassive, florid face, nor the tone of his voice,
gave any clue to what lay in his mind. “You ain’t lost
no time. Talk about marryin’&#8212;a couple of kids!” he
snorted suddenly. “I’ll have something to say about
that.”</p>

<p>“Say it, then,” Robin suggested. “Say it right now.
Let’s hear your kick on me as a man, if you have one.”</p>

<p>“There’s something else I want to talk about to you
first,” Sutherland said slowly. His glance flickered toward
the south window. “This can wait awhile. Come
out on the porch.”</p>

<p>“Dad.” May put her hands up on her father’s thick
shoulder. “You don’t really think I haven’t a right to
pick my own man, do you? You’re not going to make a
mistake like that?”</p>

<p>“I never denied you much,” he looked down at her.
“But the man that gets you’s got to be all wool an’ a
yard wide.”</p>

<p>“You won’t quarrel with Robin about me, will you?”
she wheedled.</p>

<p>“No. He won’t,” Robin put in, his pride a little in
arms at the idea of her pleading for him. “It takes two
to make a quarrel.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t quarrel,” Sutherland answered. “There
ain’t goin’ to be any argument, even.”</p>

<p>“I want to see you before you leave,” May said to
Robin.</p>

<p>“You will,” he told her. “I can promise you that.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’ll keep that promise?” old Adam’s
eyes narrowed as he asked the question.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Robin said gently. His gaze, which had followed
Sutherland’s look through the window, noted Mark
Steele standing by a porch column. He wondered how
Steele had got there unheard and how Sutherland’s
heavy tread had not warned them of his coming. He had
a flash of how completely love may absorb a man and
dull his alertness for other things. Looking now at
Shining Mark’s head and shoulders limned against the
sky he qualified his simple assertion. “Yes, if I’m on
my feet and able to navigate.”</p>

<p>Sutherland caught Robin’s meaning.</p>

<p>“There ain’t goin’ to be no show-down&#8212;not yet,” he
said. “Come on.”</p>

<p>May, too, had seen Steele.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this,” she said sharply. She caught
Robin by the arm. “I don’t want you to go out there
and meet that man. You mustn’t.”</p>

<p>Robin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I got to meet him here an’ there, sometime,” said he.
“I never did really side-step him. I surely won’t now.”</p>

<p>“Listen, my girl,” Sutherland frowned. “I’m boss of
this layout. There’ll be no private wars started here.
There may be some talk but there’ll be no shootin’.
Tyler’s right. He can’t side-step. There’s a matter of
business to be talked about. You leave keepin’ peace
between these two to me.”</p>

<p>May smiled and kissed her father brightly. Robin
marveled at her easy assurance. He doubted even Adam
Sutherland’s power to avert a clash if Shining Mark
made a move. That, it seemed to Robin, was a little
beyond even a cattle king in the heart of his own domain.</p>

<p>“You run along, now,” Sutherland told his daughter.
She obeyed at once.</p>

<p>Robin moved toward the door. Almost instinctively
he gave a little hitch forward to the gun scabbard on his
belt. Sutherland stopped him with an imperative gesture.</p>

<p>“You heard what I said.” His tone was pitched low,
but lacked none of its habitual authority. “Don’t you
make no breaks. <i>He</i> won’t. You let me walk out ahead.”</p>

<p>Robin gave way to him. He didn’t know what was
coming, but he was ready for anything. If a little tension
seized him he was nevertheless alert, mentally and
physically prepared for the unexpected.</p>

<p>Shining Mark greeted him as casually as if nothing
had ever risen between them. Robin looked at him in
silence. He couldn’t simulate that indifference. He
wouldn’t pretend. He kept his eye on Steele and his
mouth shut. Mark shrugged his shoulders, looked at
his employer.</p>

<p>“What I wanted to ask you,” Sutherland turned to
him and spoke, “was what you’re doin’ on my range with
the J7 round-up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well&#8212;&#8212;” Robin scarcely hesitated. This was as
good an opening as he wanted. It seemed almost as if
Sutherland had made it for a purpose. He couldn’t
possibly know what Robin was there for, but he could
not have led up to Robin’s opening gun more directly.
“As a matter of fact I ambled up here partly to ask you
if you had any objection to me combing your range&#8212;and
partly to see if I could make a little deal in cows
with you. I bought a bunch of cattle the other day.
That’s what I’m doin’ this side the river; gatherin’ ’em.
I wouldn’t mind sellin’ ’em to you. I only bought them
on spec.”</p>

<p>Sutherland stared at him for a few seconds and Robin
wondered if he would turn and rend him or follow the
lead&#8212;if he would understand by any chance what Robin
was driving at.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy cows any time the price is right,” he said
indifferently. “You’re sort of expandin’, aren’t you?
What you got to sell?”</p>

<p>“The T Bar S brand. There’s a lot of ’em clutterin’
up your range.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t buy you out,” Sutherland inquired, “what
do you aim to do with ’em?”</p>

<p>“Oh, somebody else’ll buy,” Robin answered. “I don’t
aim to go into the cow business myself. The outfit I
work for don’t care to have its round-up foreman ownin’
cattle.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve bought the T Bar S and you want to sell
it to me?” Sutherland commented thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Robin watched Steele closely during this exchange of
talk. He saw Mark start when he named the brand,
noted the flick of his eyelids. Beyond that the man gave
no sign. He <i>was</i> cold-blooded, Robin thought.</p>

<p>“What’s your price?” Sutherland asked.</p>

<p>“Eighteen dollars a head,” Robin announced.</p>

<p>“How many head you estimate the T Bar S’ll run?”</p>

<p>Robin could have hugged the old man for those pointed
questions. If anything could galvanize Steele into word
or deed that might expose his hand, that sort of thing
would. Selling his own stock&#8212;no matter if they were
stolen&#8212;over his head, before his own eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t say very close because I don’t know how
many more I’ll pick up. Right now I’ve got between
three and four hundred head.”</p>

<p>Sutherland continued to stare at him hard.</p>

<p>“I might dicker with you,” he said slowly. “Can you
give me a legal transfer of the T Bar S brand?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why not,” Robin said. “Anyway, I can
deliver the cattle.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you sixteen dollars.”</p>

<p>Robin took a few seconds to consider this, in reality
to watch its effect on Shining Mark. And the effect
seemed to be nil&#8212;unless a slight twisting of his mouth
meant anything more than a covert sneer.</p>

<p>“Split the difference,” he suggested. “Make it seventeen.”</p>

<p>“All right. It’s a deal at seventeen,” Sutherland
agreed.</p>

<p>“I can depend on that?” Robin inquired.</p>

<p>Sutherland frowned.</p>

<p>“My word’s never been doubted. What you mean?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s doubtin’ it now,” Robin smiled broadly. “I
just wanted to be sure you wouldn’t change your mind.
I’ll have the last of the T Bar S’s picked up in a few
days. Where do you want me to deliver?”</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” Shining Mark broke in crisply. “Before
you consider that deal closed I’d like to ask you
who you bought the T Bar S from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what your interest in the matter is,”
Robin answered him coolly. “But since you ask polite
it’s natural I’d buy from the man that owns it, Jim Bond
of Helena.”</p>

<p>“Have you got a bill of sale, and the brand transferred
to your name?” Mark asked slowly.</p>

<p>Robin’s lip curled as he looked at Steele and made
his bluff good.</p>

<p>“I’m proceedin’ to sell the T Bar S lock, stock an’
barrel to Adam Sutherland,” he said. “You can take it
I know enough about the cow business to have a clear
title.”</p>

<p>“You can’t sell nothin’ wearin’ a T Bar S to Sutherland
or anybody else,” Mark said very slowly and distinctly.
He had drawn himself straight as an arrow.
His mouth had an ugly twist. “If Jim Bond gave you
a bill of sale for the T Bar S it ain’t worth the paper the
damned old crook wrote it on. He don’t own it. He
never did. The brand registry stood in his name, but I
own the cattle and I can prove ownership. I’ve owned
’em ever since the time the T Bar S’s were turned loose
on this range. I give you notice right now. I can produce
the papers for that. You won’t deliver no T Bar
S cattle to Adam Sutherland nor anybody else, Mr.
Tyler.”</p>

<p>Anger rang in his voice. Unquestionably Shining
Mark was stirred. But he made no move beyond that
defiant speech. Robin, watching him closely, shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You may have the papers,” he said insolently. “But
I’ve got the cattle. I’ll deliver ’em to the Block S.”</p>

<p>Steele took a step forward. For a breath Robin
thought Shining Mark meant to burn powder at last
and he stiffened in his tracks, half turned, ready. But
Mark controlled his temper. He, too, shrugged his
shoulders. His lips parted, but before the words were
uttered Sutherland faced him.</p>

<p>“So you claim to own the T Bar S brand?”</p>

<p>“I do own it,” Mark said coolly.</p>

<p>“An’ you’ve owned it for two years, here on my range,
unknown to me? Hidin’ behind another man’s registry
of the brand?”</p>

<p>“I have. You can put it that way if you like.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it no way you put it, Steele,” old Adam
said. “If the J7 has gathered between three and four
hundred in that brand there’s a screw loose somewhere.
I know how many head came in here two years back.
That ain’t a natural increase. You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help what you mean,” Steele replied quite
casually. He leaned against the porch column, cocked
up one booted foot and played with the spur rowel. “If
they’ve increased plenty so much the better for me. I
own ’em. I can prove ownership. You can be suspicious
if it suits you. If you think I’ve rustled you know what
to do about that. You’ve handled rustlers before.”</p>

<p>“You have rustled, by God&#8212;an’ you’ve done worse!”
Sutherland gritted.</p>

<p>Shining Mark looked at him unmoved.</p>

<p>“That’s open to argument,” he said brazenly. “You’ve
got stock detectives. You’ve got men with eyes in their
heads. They’ve been around me all the time. If you
think you got a case, go ahead. I’ve got a clear conscience,
Sutherland. And I own that T Bar S brand.
Nobody’s goin’ to sell it but me&#8212;an’ don’t you forget
that, Mr. Robin Tyler.”</p>

<p>“I told you before you may have papers enough to
choke a cow,” Robin said. “But possession is nine points
of the law, I’ve heard. I’ve got the cattle. I’ll deliver
’em to the Block S. You can gamble on that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you will, maybe you won’t,” Shining Mark
snarled. “I’m here to tell you you won’t. I’ll tell you
something more. I’ll&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, Steele,” Sutherland stepped between
them. “You make a break on this porch and you’ll go
feet first off the ranch. You shut up an’ ride while the
ridin’s good. An’ keep ridin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll ride off your ranch fast enough,” Steele said
with an ugly laugh. “But after that I’ll ride where I
damn please. This is a free country, Sutherland. You
can’t run me out of it because you don’t like me to own
stock on your range.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a whoop about you ownin’ stock on my
range,” Sutherland growled. “But it sure don’t set well
on my stomach to have a man I trusted turn out both
a liar an’ a thief.”</p>

<p>Shining Mark laughed sardonically. He turned and
clanked down the steps.</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap but it takes money to buy whisky,” he
flung back over his shoulder. “Say what you like. Think
what you like. But don’t monkey with my cattle or you’ll
burn your fingers&#8212;both of you.”</p>

<p>He mounted and rode away. They watched him lope
toward the round-up camp. In Robin’s mind lurked a
wonder as to what Shining Mark’s next move would be.
Steele would never lie down under that, Robin knew. He
was too cool, too determined&#8212;so sure that he was safe
that he could and would defy them. The hate in his eyes
and voice spelled trouble to Robin’s discerning eye.</p>

<p>Then he turned to find Sutherland steadfastly regarding
him.</p>

<p>“I sure got a couple of enterprisin’ wagon bosses,”
the old man said tartly. “One aims to steal my cattle
and the other aims to steal my daughter.”</p>

</h2>

<p>The likening of himself to Mark Steele as a marauder
made Robin flush.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” he said stiffly. “You put us in the
same class, do you? You figure that me lovin’ your girl
and wanting her is the same as him stealin’ your calves.
I like that. I sure do!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it quite like that, kid,” Sutherland
stared absently after his thieving foreman. “But it don’t
seem like I can trust anybody any more.”</p>

<p>“You can’t trust me because I like May an’ want her,”
Robin said hotly. “It don’t occur to you that her wanting
me has anything to do with it. I’m on the level with
a thief because I want to marry your daughter, eh?
What’s the matter with me? Does a man have to be a
millionaire and a hell-roarer and a parlor lion all rolled
into one before you favor him as a son-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” Sutherland replied. “But he’s got to be
somethin’, an’ he ought to have somethin’. She’s all I’ve
got&#8212;an’ she’s just a kid. She owes me somethin’, too.
I’ve built up a fortune for her to have when I’m through.
I got to be sure it’s her, not the fortune, a man’s after&#8212;an’
that he is a man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a darn about your fortune,” Robin said
angrily. “I can make a fortune of my own, I reckon, if
I get down to it. May’s of age, anyway. If she’s the
kind of girl I think she is she’d like to have your blessin’,
but if it ain’t to be had, in a pinch she’ll do without it.
You got no right to keep her in a glass case. And I don’t
think you can.”</p>

<p>“You’re just a couple of kids,” Sutherland repeated
stubbornly. “I won’t hear of it. I don’t know whether
you’re the real thing or a false alarm, Tyler. I don’t
want to seem arbitrary, but you got to put this thing
out of your mind if you work for me.”</p>

<p>Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that,” he answered soberly. “I couldn’t
do that even if I wanted to, even to please you. I’d like
you to think I was the real thing. I don’t know how I
can do it any more than I have been doin’. I’ve had my
heart set on her ever since the first time I saw her&#8212;an’ I
think it’s the same with her. I’ll play fair, but I won’t
back down an inch where she’s concerned.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do this,” Sutherland said decisively. “You
won’t see her no more till this Shining Mark business
is settled. Then you’ll have to show me you’re capable
of handlin’ a big cow outfit, top an’ bottom, inside out,
before I’ll hear of any marryin’. I’ve only the one kid.
I’ve raised her well. I got to make sure she’s makin’
no blunder.”</p>

<p>Some instinctive wisdom forbade Robin taking issue
with that. He rebelled against Sutherland’s attitude&#8212;yet
saw dimly a certain justice on the older man’s side.
So he held his peace where his feelings urged him to
headlong defiance. He had had to be patient before. He
could be patient now.</p>

<p>And Sutherland, as if he had issued an edict which
could not be gainsaid, returned to the business in hand.</p>

<p>“So,” said he, “you took that five thousand dollars
to buy the T Bar S? What’s the idea, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I did and I didn’t,” Robin brought his mind back
to cattle and Shining Mark. “I went up to Helena prospectin’.
I ran a sort of whizzer on old Jim Bond and
found out what I wanted to be sure of. Mark owns the
T Bar S right enough, did from the beginnin’. Bond’s
just a cover, an’ he admitted that. Then I crossed the
Missouri an’ worked some range. I’ve still got your
check. I didn’t buy ’em, of course. I thought maybe I
could do that, an’ ball Mark up that way. But I didn’t
need to. I was simply runnin’ another bluff on Steele
because you gave me a good chance. I couldn’t sell the
T Bar S to you, lawful. But thinkin’ I might’ll make
him do <i>somethin’</i>. I don’t know but you could put him
in the pen right now&#8212;since he’s claimed ownership. As
a matter of fact, by actual count, I’ve got six hundred
odd T Bar S cattle in my day herd right now, at Shadow
Butte. That number just naturally proves most of ’em
stolen. A hundred and fifty head mixed stock don’t
double up twice in two years.”</p>

<p>Sutherland grunted something unintelligible. He ran
his stubby fingers through his grizzled hair and looked
at Robin. He did not say Robin had done well or ill.
He simply looked&#8212;deeply interested, very thoughtful.</p>

<p>“There’s a few more I expect, scattered around,”
Robin continued. “Do you want me to get ’em all?”</p>

<p>Sutherland didn’t answer that question directly.</p>

<p>“I expect Mark feels dead safe,” he muttered. “He
hasn’t run his iron on anything this spring. I guess
we couldn’t make out a clear case if it come to a trial.
I thought&#8212;I kinda&#8212;an’ we got to connect him up with
shootin’ Tex Matthews yet.”</p>

<p>He stood in a brown study.</p>

<p>“If he stands pat on what he’s got, an’ walks a chalkline,
we can’t do nothin’,” he said at last. “Your word
alone, an’ circumstantial evidence, won’t put him where
I want him, Tyler.”</p>

<p>“He won’t stand pat,” Robin prophesied. “I won’t
let him, for one thing. I’ll never be safe on this range
with him holdin’ out at Mayne’s. I’ve troubled Shinin’
Mark too long an’ too much. He’ll try to get me one
way or another. I can see that in his eye every time I
look him in the face. He’ll never give up the T Bar S.
And I’ve got ’em. My hunch is to keep ’em. I’d run
the Block S on every hoof, an’ see what he’d do about
it. Do you want me to hold those cattle? Two-thirds
of ’em he stole from you. Are you goin’ to let him get
away with them&#8212;and more?”</p>

<p>Sutherland ripped out an oath.</p>

<p>“I won’t let him sit like a wolf in his den at the Bar
M Bar,” he declared. “I’ll buy Mayne out. I’ll give him
all his outfit is worth. If he won’t sell I’ll freeze him
out. An’ Steele won’t have no hold out or herd to cover
up with. But about these T Bar S’s&#8212;I don’t know.
Law’s law&#8212;when it comes to property. You can’t just
grab ’em.”</p>

<p>“But I <i>have</i> grabbed ’em,” Robin declared. “The
original idea in my mind was to prove to you that he
was a darned thief. Then I went ahead an’ gathered
those cattle, gathered and held them on my own responsibility
as boss of the J7&#8212;just to make Mark show his
teeth. He will&#8212;he can’t help it if he thinks I’m out
to beat him at his own crooked game.”</p>

<p>A queer gleam showed in Sutherland’s eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s up to you,” Robin added. “I’ve run the
outfit in your interest. If you don’t want me to use
my own judgment, tell me what you want done. Say
what you want me to do with those stolen cattle.”</p>

<p>“Hold ’em,” Sutherland said briefly. “Gather all you
can find. Outside of that use your own judgment. I want
to nail that murderin’ thief&#8212;both of ’em.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s all, then,” Robin said after a brief
silence. “I want to speak to May like I promised. Then
I’ll ride.”</p>

<p>“You got to promise me you won’t be seein’ her on
the quiet,” Sutherland persisted. “You’re young an’
you’re good-lookin’. I don’t know how much more there
is to you.”</p>

<p>“If there was no more to me than that,” Robin retorted,
“I wouldn’t be runnin’ a round-up for you.”</p>

<p>“You might be a top cowman an’ still be darned poor
timber for a husband,” Sutherland observed. “A girl’s
judgment don’t go far. I got to know you better.”</p>

<p>“Hell, a fellow would think it was you I aimed to
marry, not your girl,” Robin sputtered, “the way you
want to be so sure I’m all wool and a yard wide.”</p>

<p>“It’s all in the family,” Sutherland grinned slightly,
for the first time in their conversation. “I think a heap
of that kid. I don’t aim for her to take no chances if
I can help it. Is it a promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Robin agreed. “I know I have to attend to
my work. But seein’ me once in a while is more her affair
than yours, I think. If May wants to have it that way,
yes. And only as long as she wants to have it that
way.”</p>

<p>Sutherland fished a cigar out of his pocket, bit off
the end with utmost deliberation.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you ten minutes with her,” he said. “You tell
her what I said.”</p>

<p>Old Adam was still nursing the unlighted cigar when
May and Robin came out on the porch ten minutes later,
ten minutes precisely by the clock.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” Robin said to her. “I’m on my way.”</p>

<p>She put her face up to be kissed and Robin kissed her
without regard to her male parent. Then she went back
into the house. He stood a moment.</p>

<p>“You got no particular orders for me, I suppose?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“No. I told you to use your own judgment. It’ll be
two weeks before beef round-up starts. We’ll see what
breaks by then.”</p>

<p>Robin went jingling his spurs down the porch steps.
At the bottom Sutherland halted him with a word.</p>

<p>“Look, kid,” he said. “You keep your eyes peeled
for Mark. The minute you think you’ve got him right&#8212;you
call on Tom Coats. Don’t go takin’ the law into
your own hands.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Robin smiled to himself. “I guess I
won’t do nothin’ rash.”</p>

<p>He had not told Sutherland that he already had one
of Tom Coats’ men on hand for just such an emergency,
nor that he, himself, was clothed in the majesty of such
law as Chouteau county afforded. That was his own
affair.</p>

<p>He rode away, not altogether happy, but fairly hopeful.
He had truthfully repeated Sutherland’s ultimatum
to May and she had counseled patience.</p>

<p>“I know him so well,” she said. “If we defy him he
might never forgive us. I think he likes you well enough,
Robin. But he has often hinted at ambitious things
for me. There was never a man paid me any attention
that he approved of. He has always made everything
come out the way he wanted and he can’t somehow think
of me as a woman with definite ideas of life for herself&#8212;only
as a little girl that he’s raised. So be patient,
Robin. Don’t make me a bone of contention. I will
see you now and then, all open and above-board. If in
the end we have to take the bit in our teeth, we’ll do so.
I’m game. I’d turn my back on anything for you. But
if you could be the son he’s never had, it would be better&#8212;for
all of us.”</p>

<p>And Robin had agreed; the more readily since he had
a pride of his own and Sutherland had touched it deeply.
He <i>would</i> show this cattle king that a man could amount
to something even if he were not of the pastoral blood
royal that counted its cattle on a thousand hills. And
there was Shining Mark to be coped with, one way or
another before he, Robin Tyler, could ever ride at ease
in the Bear Paws or lie down to sleep at night with no
care in his mind. Neither task would be easy; the second
held as great an element of personal danger as it did
when Robin rode for Mayne. It seemed to him that as
his career and outlook expanded life grew more complicated,
clashes more inevitable, responsibilities greater.
But he had no mind to shirk anything that loomed on
his horizon.</p>

<p>He reached his camp by Shadow Butte, slept on his
plans, and flung his riders abroad at dawn. Their circle
brought them near the Bar M Bar. Robin turned off
all but Sam Connors and jogged with Sam down by his
own cabin to have a look. He paused a second on
the bank above to have a look around. Wild cattle were
streaking westward before the J7 riders. The Mayne
ranch lay in the creek bed, a huddle of buildings and
corrals. Robin wondered, as he dropped into the flat, if
Shining Mark had transferred himself to the Bar M Bar
now that Sutherland had kicked him out.</p>

<p>He and Connors rounded the cabin. Before the door
a saddle horse that Robin knew stood with reins on the
ground, head drooping in the bright morning sun. On
the little stoop Ivy Mayne sat nursing her chin in cupped
palms. She looked up as they drew rein, sprang to her
feet and held out both hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Robin, Robin!” she cried. “I was thinkin’ about
you.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks were tear stained. The look on her face
gave Robin a pang. And there was nothing he could do
or say&#8212;nothing. He knew that. He sat in his saddle,
silent. Sam Connors glanced at the girl, at Robin.</p>

<p>“I’ll ride on a ways,” he said and was gone before
Robin could stay him or bid him go. His own instinct
was to ride on&#8212;and still&#8212;he couldn’t be brutal in the
face of her distress. Ivy held out her hands again.</p>

<p>“Get down, Robin, and talk to me&#8212;please,” she begged.
“Please.”</p>

<p>He dismounted.</p>

<p>“I was a fool.” The words tumbled out of her hysterically.
“Come back, Robin. I want you.”</p>

<p>She flung herself at him. Robin caught her by the
shoulders, held her at arm’s length, looked down at her
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Get hold of yourself,” he commanded. “Don’t act
crazy. You don’t want me. You’d ’a’ kept me when
you had me, if you’d wanted. You can’t play with a
man, discard him, and pick him up again, just as you
take the notion. You know that. What’s the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>She turned away from him with a stifled sob.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know, I know,” she wailed. “I’ve lost you. I
<i>am</i> crazy. I’ve always been crazy. I ought to kill
myself an’ I haven’t got the nerve. Oh Robin, Robin,
I wish I was dead!”</p>

<p>She sank into that huddled posture on the step and
cried in a way that made Robin ache. Then suddenly,
while he wondered if it were wise or kind to say more,
or if it would be better to ride away and leave her, she
stopped weeping, looked up at him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean what I said,” she whispered. “I don’t
know why I said it. I know you haven’t any use for
me an’ I don’t blame you. I am about crazy, Robin.
You better ride along. Mark Steele’s ragin’ around this
country somewhere.”</p>

<p>“He was at the Block S yesterday an’ he didn’t seem
particularly ragin’ when I was around,” Robin said
quietly. “Has somethin’ happened?”</p>

<p>“He’s got me in trouble an’ just laughs at me,” she
said wearily. “I don’t know what I’m goin’ to do. Dad’ll
just about kill me when he finds out. Or he’ll go after
Mark an’ get killed himself.”</p>

<p>“He can’t give you the worst of it that way,” Robin
fairly sputtered. “He promised to marry you, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s nothin’ to him,” she sighed. “Promises
don’t mean nothin’ to Mark Steele. I took care of
him last winter when he was shot, like he was a baby.
He fixed it up to buy a half interest with dad this spring
when he fell into that money. He’s backed out of everything.
He rode in last night fairly foamin’ about somethin’.
He had some things there he wanted. He got ’em
an’ rode away an’ as good as told us both to go to hell.
He was wild. I never saw him so ugly.”</p>

<p>Robin could easily guess the fury that raged in Steele
once he had time to think, feeling himself checkmated,
his liberty as well as the fruits of his crafty stealing
endangered by Robin’s latest move. But that was no
matter to be discussed with Ivy. He was sorry for her&#8212;but&#8212;&#8212;She
looked at him and her lips quivered.
Then a curious gleam lit her dark eyes.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t met that tow-headed Sutherland girl,
this wouldn’t ’a’ happened,” she blazed out at him.</p>

<p>There was no dealing with that oblique reasoning.
Robin knew Ivy’s wayward moods of old. He made a
little impatient gesture. Ivy rose.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to the Block S one of these days an’ tear
her eyes out,” she said passionately.</p>

<p>“Look,” Robin said sternly. “You had me. You
could always have had me. I’d ’a’ stuck through anything.
But he came along when I was hoein’ a hard row.
You got to despisin’ me an’ admirin’ him. That’s all
there is to it. When I came back after jumpin’ the country
because I thought I’d killed him, you had dropped me
like a hot potato. Don’t go blamin’ another woman for
somethin’ you did yourself, because you wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Both of ’em.” Ivy gritted her white teeth. “I got it
in for both of ’em, her an’ Mark. He could ’a’ left me
alone, an’ she could ’a’ left you alone an’ it would ’a’
been all right. I hate them both. I have a mind to
ride to the Block S and shame ’em before everybody.
That’s what I started out to do this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Better turn around an’ go home,” Robin counseled.
“No good actin’ like a crazy woman. Go home an’ make
a clean breast of it to the old man an’ let him deal with
Shinin’ Mark.”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid. Everybody’s afraid of Mark Steele,”
she sneered. “He’d say I was to blame for givin’ in, an’
he’d about kill me. All he thinks anything of is his
cattle. He’s wild now because Mark backed out of the
partnership. Says Mark’s a darned cheatin’ cow thief.”</p>

<p>“He is, too,” Robin said coldly. “Only he’s as bad as
Mark because he knew that long ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care what he is,” she cried. “I don’t
care. I’m so near crazy I don’t care who is what, or
what happens.”</p>

<p>“No good feelin’ like that,” Robin tried to soothe
her. “Go home an’ try to settle down an’ forget it.
You ain’t the first girl that trusted a man that was no
good. You’re better off without him.”</p>

<p>Ivy began to whimper again. Against that flood of
rage and grief and fear Robin was helpless. He was
sorry, but there was nothing he could do. He had his
own crow to pick with Mark Steele. Ivy’s plight added
only a more burning contempt to the score already
laid against the man. So far as he was concerned Ivy
Mayne and the Bar M Bar was a closed book.</p>

<p>“I got to go,” he said gently. “Don’t cry. Don’t
worry. You’ll come out all right. So long.”</p>

<p>He swung up on his horse. Ivy made no move to stay
him. Only she looked up at him with big dusky eyes in
which a fire glowed, the old dumb sullen protest that he
remembered when she was crossed in her desires.</p>

<p>Sam Connors waited for him on the crest of the opposite
bank. Robin joined him, rode a little way, and looked
back. Ivy had mounted, she was galloping away from
his cabin&#8212;but not toward home. She took to the bench
land above the creek. As far as Robin watched her
she loped steadily north&#8212;straight toward the Block S.</p>

<p>He remembered her threat, wondered if she would try
to make it good, and the thought made him a little sick
at heart. Shining Mark wouldn’t be at the Block S.
Ivy was just frantic enough to do anything, say anything.
The storm in her breast was driving her mad.</p>

<p>He shook up his horse and bore away toward the
round-up ground where the J7 riders had bunched their
cattle. He worked that herd with a troubled mind.
There were too many crossed wires. A sense of
something like impending disaster harassed him far into the
night. Long after the cook was snoring in the opposite
corner of the chuck tent Robin lay staring at the canvas
overhead, listening to the faint jingle of bells among the
grazing <i>remuda</i>, hearing the night wind flutter the guy
ropes.</p>

<p>In his mind there suddenly flashed up the picture of
Shining Mark sagging to his knees that frosty afternoon
in the Birch Creek line camp.</p>

<p>“I wish to God I <i>had</i> killed him that time,” Robin
thought. “I’ll have to kill him yet. He’s done more
damage already than any man should do an’ live.”</p>

<p>It was, Robin felt sadly, a little late for purely vindictive
reprisal. But there was still such a thing as
simple justice, which must somewhere, sometime, overtake
such a man as Mark Steele.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXIV' title="XXIV—THE BACKWASH">
<span style='font-size:1.2em;'>CHAPTER XXIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em;'>THE BACKWASH</span>
</h2>

<p>The J7 took a short swing eastward, turned back
when T Bar S’s grew scarce, and pitched camp one
evening on Birch Creek below Cold Spring within sight
of where Robin first saw with a shock of surprise the
flash of silver on a rustler’s gear. The Bad Lands lay
in a tumbled stretch below. A few thickets of jack pine
spotted the valley walls, made dark patches about the
heads of those torn gulches. Birch Creek was a mere
trickle in its alkali bed. It was like the jaws of hell for
heat in that deep, sage-floored bottom. At dawn, when
the riders saddled and mounted, the air was cool and
scented with the odor of bruised sage.</p>

<p>Robin sat half-turned in his saddle watching the
wagons vanish up the steep pitch of a draw that led
to high ground. The day herd and the saddle bunch
climbed the slope in long files. Very soon he would
finish that gathering. In and around Chase Hill he expected
to end the clean-up. After that&#8212;he was wondering
what would come after that, as he sat there.</p>

<p>Some of his riders sat quietly resting gloved hands
on their saddle horns. Some rolled a final cigarette.
Two or three were giving the last tightening to their
cinches.</p>

<p>Something stung Robin in the side, like a hornet, or
the touch of a live coal. Involuntarily he flinched. The
prick of his spur, the lurch of his body, startled the
nervous brute under him. Touch and movement were
simultaneous. Already off balance, when the horse
spun like an uncoiled spring, Robin lost his seat&#8212;went
headlong to earth, precisely as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>That was no mere conjecture flashing through his
brain as he fell. He saw a dust spurt rise twenty feet
beyond him while he was yet in mid-air. And he lay
still where he had fallen, listening for a sound that made
the tale complete&#8212;the clear, staccato report of a rifle.</p>

<p>Every detail of what occurred, every possibility, stood
clear in Robin’s mental and visual processes. He saw
two other horses jump and swerve at the spurt of dust.
He knew where his own horse stood when the shot was
fired, and so marked the line of the bullet’s flight, a point
on the eastern bank three hundred yards distant, perhaps
three hundred feet above the flat, a spot masked by a
clump of scrubby pines.</p>

<p>He did not rise. He did not move. He lay watching,
and his riders flung themselves off their horses to gather
around him. His fall and that crack told them the story.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt bad?” they cried.</p>

<p>“Never mind me,” Robin said. “Look. See that
bunch of pine? That’s where he fired from. Go get
him. Get him alive if you can, but get him. Spread
out and burn the earth. Quick, or he’ll slip you in the
rough country.”</p>

<p>One man stayed with him, knelt beside him. The
others flung themselves astride, broke away on the run,
spreading fanwise as they rode. Every man was armed.
Robin had seen that they rode armed once they crossed
the Big Muddy. Two or three carried rifles under their
stirrup leathers. Robin smiled to himself as the dust
rolled out from under those drumming hoofs.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to go some to get away. And if he does
he’ll think he got me,” he reflected. Then, in answer to
Jim Stratton’s anxious query:</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t feel as if I was finished. But
somethin’ sure stung me. Guess I’ll look.”</p>

<p>Baring his waist showed a red line like a scar of a
brand, where the bullet had seared his skin.</p>

<p>“Now that’s what I’d call close,” Robin commented.
“Darned if it didn’t feel like it had plowed right through
me. She sure stings but don’t amount to much. Get my
horse, Jim. I’m all right.”</p>

<p>Stratton galloped over to where Robin’s mount after
a brief bolt stood still on the fallen reins. He led him
back, Robin got up, mounted, nursing that sharp pain
in his side and a bruised shoulder from the fall, but
practically unharmed.</p>

<p>“We’ll join the hunt,” he said briefly, and rode for
the eastern bank.</p>

<p>Empty bench land, brown and yellow with ripe grass,
a network of coulees, canyons, ravines, clumps of pines,
great areas of sagebrush, the Bear Paws looming high
and blue on the north, met their gaze. No riders moved
in sight, only a few bunches of wild cattle stirred to
flight by the pursuit.</p>

<p>“Hark!” said Stratton, after a minute. “They’ve
opened the ball.”</p>

<p>A burst of shots rose, echoed, died away. The plains
silence closed in again. The morning air fanned their
faces, rippled the long grass. They waited, watching,
five minutes, ten, half an hour, the sun dazzling their
eyes as they looked to the east.</p>

<p>“There they come,” Robin pointed.</p>

<p>Two miles off a group of horsemen debouched from a
hollow, riding slowly. Robin and Stratton loosed their
mounts to a gallop.</p>

<p>On a horse led by Sam Connors and flanked by the J7
riders sat Tommy Thatcher. He was disarmed, hatless,
his hands tied behind his back. A smear of blood
streaked his face. He rode a J7 horse and the rider
of that horse sat riding double behind another man’s
cantle. The J7 men grinned widely at Robin and Robin
stared at Thatcher.</p>

<p>“Lucky we were,” Sam Connors said. “We dropped
his horse at long range an’ Mr. Man went down so hard
he didn’t come to till we closed in on him.”</p>

<p>“I busted him one when he started to get gay,” said
the rider who was mounted double, “so they made me
give him my horse, they was so kind to him. I’d ’a’
made the skunk trot at the end of a lass-rope. What’ll
we do with him, Tyler? Name your poison.”</p>

<p>Robin lifted his hat and ran his fingers through the
mat of his curly hair. He didn’t speak to Thatcher.
The man stared at him in dumb fear.</p>

<p>“First it was shootin’ cows to steal their calves. Then
it was Tex Matthews. Now it’s me,” he mused. Aloud,
he said:</p>

<p>“Bring him down into the creek.”</p>

<p>They plowed up the loose earth on the steep bank,
gained the sage-gray bottom. Where the canyon from
Cold Spring joined Birch Creek three gnarly old cottonwoods
grew, a trio like the weird sisters. They stood
within half a mile of where Mark Steele and Thatcher
shot the Bar M Bar cows. Robin remembered those
trees. He led the way until his riders were bunched
in the leafy shade. Thick, crooked limbs spread from
the rough-barked trunks fifteen feet above ground.</p>

<p>“Heave a rope over that branch,” Robin pointed.</p>

<p>The Texan’s face blanched. For a second or two the
J7 men looked startled.</p>

<p>“I sure do despise a bushwhacker,” one reckless youth
said at last. “I’ll donate my rope in a good cause.”</p>

<p>He flung the noosed end deftly over a stout limb.</p>

<p>“Lead him under,” Robin spoke again.</p>

<p>Connors gave the lead rope to a J7 man, wheeled his
horse aside and sat looking thoughtfully at Robin. The
J7 man led the horse Thatcher bestrode under the
dangling noose.</p>

<p>“Put it around his neck. Tighten it up and tie the
end to the tree,” Robin ordered.</p>

<p>Robin’s young face was hard as iron. He looked at
the shrinking Texan and there was no mercy in his eyes.
The horse that bore Thatcher was gentle. He stood
passive, a living scaffold, such as the old West devised
for the speedy execution of malefactors long before Robin
Tyler was born. A flick of a rope-end and the beast
would leap from under, to leave Thatcher’s spurred heels
kicking three feet clear of mother earth. Robin raised
his braided quirt. Thatcher’s lips trembled.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Tyler, take this rope off my neck!”
he pleaded. “Give me a chance for my life. I’ll talk.”</p>

<p>“What chance did you give Tex Matthews or me?”
Robin sneered. “You’re not gagged. Speak out if you
want.”</p>

<p>“Take away the rope,” Thatcher begged. “I’ll cough
it all up, if you won’t hang me here. Shinin’ Mark’s
the man you want, not me.”</p>

<p>“Say what you want,” Robin answered coldly. “I
make no promises. It’s hangin’ or the pen for you, anyway.”</p>

<p>“If I hang, I want him to hang with me,” the Texan
mumbled. “He got me into this. I’ll take a chance on
the penitentiary if you’ll keep me off’n this tree.”</p>

<p>“Say your say,” Robin lowered his quirt.</p>

<p>“Steele’s been rustlin’ off the Bar M Bar an’ the
Block S for two seasons, brandin’ what he stole with
the T Bar S, which he owns on the quiet. I’ve been in
with him from the start. He got a hold over me an’ I
had to go through. At first we shot the cows, like we did
that day a year ago in this here bottom, when you rode
down an’ looked for the brand on that cow. It was Mark
took a crack at you that day. Mostly we cut back cows
with big calves an’ separated ’em later. We had a corral
in the Bad Lands down toward Cow Creek where we
got in our work late in the fall. A lot of the stuff we
threw across the Missouri on the ice. It was Steele shot
Tex Matthews when we got onto you fellers prowlin’
down there. He tried to get you too. An’ we was
lookin’ for you, figurin’ how we could get away with you
the time we walked in on you asleep in the Birch Creek
line camp&#8212;the day you turned Mark’s gun back on him
an’ shot him in the neck.</p>

<p>“When you jumped the country thinkin’ you’d killed
him, he figured it was all clear. When you come back
this spring he was scared to rustle, and he was leary of
jumpin’ you in public. He began to think you was
tougher game than he’d reckoned. Then he got worried
when he knew you was runnin’ the J7 round-up in the
Judith because he knew you’d come on lots of T Bar S
yearlin’s. When you blew into the Block S the other day
an’ made that play about havin’ bought the T Bar S an’
undertook to sell it to Sutherland, he knew the stuff was
off an’ he had to claim ownership. He figured he could
bluff Sutherland since there wasn’t enough proof to convict
him. But he was afraid you’d either keep on his
trail until you got evidence, or you an’ Sutherland would
just naturally grab every T Bar S in sight an’ hold ’em
in spite of hell. So he foamed around after Sutherland
fired him an’ decided we had to kill you first chance an’
that would be the end of it. You were the only man in
the country that really knew how it was worked. So he
put it up to me to ambush you. I’ve been layin’ for
you for three days. That’s all. I’ll swear to that in
court if you take him alive.”</p>

<p>The J7 men had crowded close to listen.</p>

<p>“By the Lord,” one growled. “You sure ought to
hang. A cow thief an’ a murderer. Will I hit old Bones
a clip, Robin?”</p>

<p>“Untie the rope,” Robin said calmly. “We’ll let the
sheriff of Chouteau county hang him an’ Shinin’ Mark
together.”</p>

<p>“One other thing,” Robin said when Thatcher’s neck
was free of the noose. “Where is Mark Steele now?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I expect,” Thatcher mumbled, “he’ll be
around somewheres in public establishin’ a alibi for
himself, in case he got accused of shootin’ you. I’ve had
to do the dirty work.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Robin nodded to Sam Connors. That individual
moved up beside Thatcher.</p>

<p>“You’re under arrest by a qualified officer,” he said
pleasantly. “We’ll treat you nice, an’ have you safe in
jail at Fort Benton inside of twenty-four hours. So
behave yourself.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” Robin addressed his crew. “You’ve heard
his yarn. It’s true. I’ve been up against this for a
year. Keep your mouths shut tight about all this until
you’re called in court as witnesses. Shinin’ Mark won’t
be as easy to handle as this fellow. Now, two of you
ride, one on each side of him, to camp.”</p>

<p>They moved off in a cavalcade. Sam Connors fell in
beside Robin, looking curiously at him.</p>

<p>“If he hadn’t weakened would you ’a’ hung him?” he
asked at last.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Robin answered truthfully. “Maybe.
But he did weaken.”</p>

<p>“You had me guessin’,” Connors observed. “I couldn’t
hardly ’a’ stood for a lynchin’. Did you figure he’d squeal
when you made that hangin’ play?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Robin admitted. “That’s why I made it. I’ve
got ’em both dead to rights now. Next thing is to round
up Shinin’ Mark Steele. Then this range’ll be clean
once more.”</p>

</h2>

<p>On a little hillock that gave a clear view all around
Robin pulled up his horse. He rode alone. Now of all
times he must be wary. Thatcher had failed. If Steele
knew Thatcher had not only failed but had confessed his
sins to save his neck, he would certainly be in the mood
to take a desperate chance. He <i>might</i> be riding the hills
on the same errand as Thatcher. So Robin looked well
from all the high ground and rode fast in the low places.
There was no shame in being cautious. A second bullet
might not simply graze him.</p>

<p>Over westward he could see a little dark cluster moving
rapidly across the rolling land. That was Sam Connors
and his prisoner with two J7 men for bodyguard.
Connors could make the evening train by riding hard.
Nightfall would see the Texan safe in the county jail.
Nightfall, Robin hoped, would also see Mark Steele at the
end of his tether. The blank warrant in his pocket Robin
had already filled in. He meant to leave no loopholes because
he meant to take Mark Steele wherever he found
him. If Mark anticipated his purpose and resisted then
the outcome was on the knees of the gods.</p>

<p>Shining Mark might be at the Bar M Bar; he might be
at the Block S camp, he might be in town. He was bold
and crafty. He might indeed be anywhere, but in those
three places in the order named Robin proposed to look
for him. He had a grim satisfaction to stiffen his purpose.
There was no loophole left for Shining Mark now.
Robin had been patient, he had endured much, and he
did not love his enemies.</p>

<p>Steele was not at the Bar M Bar. Neither was Mayne
nor his daughter. A ranch hand told Robin they had
gone to town. He bore on up to the Block S. The
round-up tents stood white on the green border of an irrigated
meadow but the Sutherland riders knew nothing
of Mark. Jack Boyd did inform Robin that old Adam
and May had departed in the buggy three or four days
earlier. Robin knew that the bay trotters were likely
to have but one destination.</p>

<p>“Me for Big Sandy,” he reflected&#8212;and borrowed a
fresh horse out of the Block S <i>remuda</i>.</p>

<p>Thus mounted he burned the earth, in range parlance,
toward town. As he rode his personal danger from ambush
became less of moment than the possibility of Mark
Steele slipping through his fingers. Mark would do one
of two things the moment he learned that Thatcher had
been taken red-handed; either he would go gunning for
Robin or he would jump the country. He had money.
That inheritance of fifteen thousand dollars which he had
<i>not</i> put into the Bar M Bar partnership would take him
far and fast&#8212;if he chose to own himself beaten and quit
the field.</p>

<p>That contingency worried Robin. He had made two
definite promises both to himself and Shining Mark, one
in anger, the other in cold blood, to kill him or put him
in the penitentiary. He meant to keep one or the other.</p>

<p>In the freshness of his anger that morning with
Thatcher’s fear-wrung story to cap the climax, Robin
had set out to take his man single-handed.</p>

<p>Now, as he loped out of the foothills, he was not so
sure of the wisdom of that plan. To act alone savored
a little of satisfying a personal grudge, which he admitted
to himself&#8212;and he reflected that making Steele’s arrest
a personal, single-handed affair might easily permit Mark
to evade justice altogether.</p>

<p>Wherefore, by the time town loomed in the tenuous
heat haze that quivered above a parched earth, Robin had
decided to consult Adam Sutherland first. He could still
grab Steele wherever he found him, but perhaps the entire
machinery of the sheriff’s office had better be in motion.
Montana covered a lot of territory. If Shining
Mark went on the dodge he would take some catching.</p>

<p>So he rode to the store on an angle that took him between
the stockyards and the rows of houses that formed
the one short street. A clerk stood in the door that
Robin had to pass on his way to the front. He pulled up.</p>

<p>“Sutherland inside?”</p>

<p>“Went over to the house a while ago,” the man told
him.</p>

<p>Robin didn’t tarry. In two minutes he was striding
up the front steps of the white cottage. Sutherland rose
out of a chair behind a canvas screen. May appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Come on inside,” Sutherland said. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“How do you know anything’s up?” Robin asked when
he doffed his hat in the cool room. He stole a look at
May. She smiled welcome but there was a sort of shadow
in her blue eyes, a something Robin had never seen there,
a troubled, apprehensive expression.</p>

<p>“I see two of your men with Sam Connors an’ that
Texican ride in just as the west-bound stopped. Connors
an’ Thatcher took the train. Your two boys say they
just rode in for fun. You come ridin’ a Block S horse
all sweat an’ foam.”</p>

<p>“You notice things, don’t you,” Robin drawled.
“Well, somethin’ is up. Do you happen to know if Mark
Steele is in Big Sandy?”</p>

<p>A look flashed between father and daughter.</p>

<p>“I don’t spend no time keepin’ track of Mark myself,”
Sutherland said dryly. “Maybe he is. Maybe he isn’t.
Why? Sit down an’ spin your yarn.”</p>

<p>Robin spun it briefly.</p>

<p>“So I took a second thought and figured two heads was
better than one,” he ended. “Maybe it’ll be as well to
stir up Tom Coats and notify the other county officers,
so they’ll all be on the lookout for him if he hides out.
If he does happen to be in Big Sandy or rides in here
I’ll drop my own loop on him. If he don’t know we got
Thatcher he’ll feel safe to go anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Hm&#8212;m.” Sutherland nursed his chin in one hand,
twirled and tugged by turns at his mustache. He looked
first at Robin, then at his daughter. His expression told
nothing. He rose at last.</p>

<p>“You’ve done a good stroke of business, kid,” he said.
“I’ll amble over an’ send a wire to Fort Benton. You
stay here.”</p>

<p>“I ought to stable my horse,” Robin took thought. “I
sure rode him hard.”</p>

<p>“He’ll keep. Block S saddle stock is used to hard
ridin’,” Sutherland observed. “I won’t be gone but a
minute or two. I want to talk this over with you some
more. You stay right here till I come back. I guess May
won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Robin agreed. He had to suppress a
self-conscious grin at the last sentence. He didn’t know
why Sutherland took that tack, unless May had worked
some magic on him. But Robin certainly didn’t think
she would mind.</p>

<p>May flung herself into his arms the moment her father
was out the door.</p>

<p>“Glad to see me?” Robin asked with a tender smile.</p>

<p>She nodded, her head on his breast.</p>

<p>“I worry about you now I know you’re this side of
the river.” She lifted her head to look into his face.
“That man is deadly&#8212;deadly and despicable. Ivy
Mayne came up to the ranch one day last week.”</p>

<p>“Yes? I met her at my old homestead one morning.
She was pretty wild then. She started off toward the
Block S, but I didn’t think she’d go through.”</p>

<p>“She was nearly insane with fear and grief,” May
told him soberly. “And she blurted out all her troubles
to dad and me when she found Mark wasn’t there. Did
she tell you what was wrong, Robin?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Poor thing! She’s a queer, awfully intense creature,
and foolish&#8212;but it is rather terrible for her, Robin.
I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” Robin murmured. “But I can’t do anything
about it, that I know of.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do much but I’m going to do what I can.
Ivy’s here now.”</p>

<p>“Here in your house?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” May nodded. “In one of the bedrooms. I’ve
got her calmed down from that frenzy she was in. I’m
going to take her away to Helena. Her father doesn’t
know. He’s a poor stick anyway. He’s been raving to
dad all morning about this wretched cattle business.
And&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly. Her arms tightened about
Robin.</p>

<p>“You’re an angel,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“You were fond of her, weren’t you, Robin?” she muttered.</p>

<p>“That was before I knew you,” Robin answered slowly.
“And I guess it wouldn’t have amounted to anything anyway.
Mark was always in her mind more or less. I did
like her, though. You’ve liked other men before you ever
saw me, I guess, hon?”</p>

<p>“Not much. Well, yes, I once liked a boy who broke
horses for us long before I knew you, Robin,” she said
honestly. “He was a rider like you. A horse fell with him
and killed him. I thought a lot of him. But somehow
not the way I think and feel about you, dear.”</p>

<p>Robin kissed her.</p>

<p>“I guess maybe it was the same with both of us,” he
said. “We were both lookin’ for somebody we wanted.
I had the feelin’ that I’d found something real the first
time I met you&#8212;the night we rode up the hill above
Little Birch and talked while the sun went down. Remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she smiled. “I had the same feeling about
you&#8212;and it grows stronger. I’ll be glad when that
murdering thief is dead or in jail. I’m afraid for you
Robin. You’ve taken so many chances. You may not
always be lucky. What would I do if anything happened
to you, Robin?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to take chances,” Robin declared. “A man
has to. Mark is about at the end of his rope now. He’s
overplayed his hand.”</p>

<p>May shuddered a little.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she sighed, “but he’s still in the game.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he <i>is</i> in town,” Robin’s eyes hardened.</p>

<p>“It isn’t your place to go after him if he is,” she
demurred. “Let the county officers get him. He’ll try
to kill you, if it’s the last thing he does.”</p>

<p>“By jiminy!” Robin put his hands on her shoulders
and looked at her searchingly. “I believe he is in town
an’ you know it. Your dad knows he’s here?”</p>

<p>May flushed.</p>

<p>“Steele is in Big Sandy,” she admitted. “He’s been
here since yesterday drinking and&#8212;and&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>Robin turned. May caught him with both hands.</p>

<p>“Robin!” she cried. “No. You promised dad you’d
stay here till he came back.”</p>

<p>“While I stand here talkin’ Steele may be ridin’,”
Robin said. “Gettin’ him is my job. If I didn’t owe
it to him, I’m an officer. I got myself deputized to have
the law on my side. Even if I wasn’t I’d go after him
anyway. He rode me rough. He murdered a good friend.
He’s a thief. I will get him&#8212;alive if I can; but I’ll get
him if he’s here.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” May pleaded. “I wouldn’t have
you shirk. But wait till dad comes back. He’s old and
very wise, Robin, and he likes you. If he says you should
go ahead and arrest Mark Steele I won’t say another
word.”</p>

<p>They stood for a second or two, clasped close. The
blood leaped quicker in Robin’s veins. So Shining Mark
was in town? Very soon now there would be an end to
this coil in which he had been entangled so long. One
way or the other it would be finished. If Mark opened
war on sight it would be an even break&#8212;and Robin
asked no more, wanted no more. And if Steele hesitated
the fraction of a second then he would get the
drop on him and Shining Mark would go to Fort Benton
alive to answer before the law for his misdeeds. Even
with his sweetheart in his arms Robin’s instinct was to
seek Steele and get it over.</p>

<p>As he made a move to put May’s arms aside, distantly,
as if muffled, faintly through the open door two shots
sounded so close together that an untrained ear might
have heard but one. Then another single report. After
that dead silence, in which Robin, already on the top
step, halted to listen.</p>

<p>“I wonder?” he said to May at his elbow.</p>

<p>He had no definite reason for wondering. When cowboys
were in Big Sandy revolver shots were a commonplace.
The cow-puncher in his exuberance used a
six-shooter in much the same spirit a small boy sets off
fire-crackers. His Colt was at once a weapon and a toy.</p>

<p>But there was no sound of hilarity, no light-hearted
whooping. Neither of the J7 men had been in long
enough to get drunk. All the Block S riders were on
Little Eagle. There might be stray stock hands in town.
Yet Robin was troubled by those shots, that uncommon
stillness which followed. It was a scant two hundred
yards to the hotel, the Silver Dollar, the other saloons.
Not a sound, not a voice, was uplifted in that hush.</p>

<p>“That’s funny. I’m going over.”</p>

<p>“Robin&#8212;please!”</p>

<p>“I got to,” he said desperately.</p>

<p>He pressed a kiss on her lips, shook off her clutching
hands, and ran. He glanced back once. May stood
where he left her looking after him, the raking sun rays
striking golden gleams on her head. Through Robin’s
mind flashed the thought that it might be his last sight
of her. But he went on quickly. If he met Shining
Mark and luck was against him at any rate her kiss was
sweet on his lips.</p>

<p>The corpulent host of the hotel stood outside his bar-room
door.</p>

<p>“What was the shootin’?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>“Somet’ing happen ober dere, yes,” the man said
placidly. “Everybody go to see. Vot iss, I do not
know, already yet.”</p>

<p>Robin crossed the street, walked in through the open
door of Monty’s Place, alert, nerves tense, looking first
of all for sight of a lean, dark face with gray eyes that
held malice whenever they rested on him.</p>

<p>And Shining Mark was almost the first man he saw.
But there was no malice in his eyes now. He was
stretched full-length on the floor, a white-handled Colt
three feet from his outspread fingers. A shaft from the
sinking sun played on his face through a window and
a fly buzzed over him in the yellow beam.</p>

<p>Adam Sutherland sat in a chair. Men stood about him
in a circle. A professional looking person in a white
shirt, with his sleeves rolled up, was swathing a bandage
about Sutherland’s naked middle. The old man looked
up at Robin and smiled.</p>

<p>“I beat you to him,” he said a little hoarsely. “He
was on the warpath an’ I settled his hash.”</p>

<p>Robin said nothing. There was nothing to say. Death
is sobering. No one talked much. When a man did
speak he lowered his voice. Some one appeared with
a canvas and spread it over Shining Mark. Even old
Mayne, bearing all the marks of drunkenness which made
his tongue wag always beyond all restraint, looked
silently at Sutherland and kept still. The man who
owned the saloon said to Robin:</p>

<p>“Lucky Doc happened to be here. Came up from
Havre to look after a sick woman. So we got him right
off.”</p>

<p>“There you are, Mr. Sutherland,” the doctor stood
back and surveyed his handiwork. “Rest easy for a few
days and you’ll be as good as ever. I’ll look in in the
morning and dress that again. Better get a rig to take
you over to your house.”</p>

<p>“Shucks.” Sutherland stood up and tucked in his shirt,
waving off the men who would have supported him. “I
don’t need nobody but Tyler to help me home. A scratch
like that. Shucks!”</p>

<p>Robin lent him his arm. They passed out the door,
crossed the dusty street, Sutherland leaning on Robin,
walking slowly. As they cleared the hotel, May watching
from the porch saw them and came on flying feet.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, and again, “Oh, dad, dad!”</p>

<p>“It’s nothin’ <i>a</i>-tall. Now don’t fuss, for the love of
Mike. I’m all right. It’s all over. Let’s not have any
shoutin’.”</p>

<p>May took his other arm. They passed up the steps,
inside, into Sutherland’s bedroom.</p>

<p>“Now you leave us be, May,” he said. “I want to
talk to Robin.”</p>

<p>“Please, daddy, tell me,” she begged. “Are you hurt
badly? I must know.”</p>

<p>“No, girl, I ain’t, and that’s God’s truth,” he answered.
“If I was I’d tell you. You ain’t the screamin’
kind. A bullet ripped up the flesh between my ribs, an’
that’s all. You seen me tore up a heap worse, one time.
There’s nothin’ to worry about. You run along.”</p>

<p>She kissed him and left the room. Sutherland sat
down on the edge of his bed, eased himself to the pillows,
grinned feebly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t so young as I used to be,” he mumbled to
Robin. “I want to get my wind for a spell. Then you
can pull off my boots an’ help me undress.”</p>

<p>He shut his eyes. Robin stood waiting, silent.</p>

<p>In a minute or so old Adam spoke again.</p>

<p>“There. I felt kinda wabbly but it’s gone now. Give
me a hand.”</p>

<p>Robin helped him get ready for bed, put his clothes
away in a closet.</p>

<p>“I’ll be off my feet for a spell, I reckon,” Sutherland
began to talk with something of his old vigor. “You’ll
have to be a sort of general superintendent, Tyler. Pick
a good man out of your crew to run the J7. Leave Boyd
<i>segundo</i> on the home wagon till you can take it over
yourself. Run the Block S on them cattle you got. We’ll
keep ’em, every darned hoof. Well, I expect they stole
quite a few from old Mayne, so you better mark, say,
about a hundred head for him. I guess that’s all for
just now. You’ll have to be in an’ out of here pretty
frequent while I’m on my back.”</p>

<p>“Why did you tangle with Mark Steele?” Robin demanded.
“Why didn’t you leave him to me? It was my
job.”</p>

<p>“Mine too. He stole from me. He murdered a man
I thought a lot of. He was a dirty dog all around. He
give that fool girl of Mayne’s a raw deal. I felt kinda
responsible, because I put him in a position to do some
of them things. I been boilin’ inside the last two or
three days. An’ he was makin’ breaks about you here
in town. He was bad an’ he was game. I didn’t feel
like lettin’ you take a chance.</p>

<p>“Gosh darn it, this hole in my ribs don’t amount to
much, but it sure hurts,” he complained. “No, kid, I
couldn’t let you go up against that <i>hombre</i>. I’ve lived
my life an’ it don’t matter so much. This kid of mine
thinks a heap of you. I couldn’t let you go against as
hard a proposition as Mark Steele. An’ there was no
time to wait for deputies. You would ’a’ gone after
him in spite of hell an’ high water the minute you knew
he was in town. So I went after him myself. I’ve stood
out against gun play for years now. But you notice I
ain’t sheddin’ no tears.”</p>

<p>“Nor me,” Robin replied. “Only I wish you hadn’t
took him off my hands at your own risk.”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” Sutherland rumbled. “You take the runnin’
of the Block S off <i>my</i> hands an’ we’ll call it square. If
there’s anything in what I’ve had to listen to from May
the last few days it’s all in the family anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You mean that?” Robin asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ll do,” Sutherland grinned. “I was only
joshin’ you at the ranch last week. Wanted to see how
you’d take it. I’d trust May’s judgment in a matter of
that kind, even if I doubted my own&#8212;which I don’t.
Hit the trail an’ tell her how the play come up with
Mark&#8212;an’ tell Lum Yip to bring me some ice water.”</p>

<p>Robin delivered this order to the Chinese boy. Then
he found May, told her briefly what had happened. She
dashed off to her father’s room again. In a minute she
came back, flushed, laughing.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the grandest old person,” she said to Robin.
“Do you know what he said to me? He said: ‘Get to
blazes out of here and leave me rest! Go an’ plague
that fellow you’re goin’ to marry. He’ll be sorry when
he gets to know what he’s got on his hands as well as I
do.’”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Robin grunted. “If the fellow lives till he’s
sorry he’ll beat Methuselah’s record for old age.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out on the porch,” she suggested.</p>

<p>Robin stood with his arms about her looking off
toward the blue dome of Old Centennial, the sharp cone
of Shadow Butte. The sun dipped low, its rim touching
the horizon. Distant windows flashed like heliographs.
A cool breeze fluttered the porch awnings.</p>

<p>In his mind’s eye Robin could see all the beauty of
those distant hills, the far reach of the plains. Something
seemed to have been mysteriously restored to him,
some dark cloud blown away, something seemed to have
set his heart singing and uplifted him with a strangely
comforting sense of peace and security.</p>

<p>He drew the girl up close to him, and they stood for
a long time in silence, Robin’s fingers playing hide and
seek in the tangle of her yellow hair.</p>
